Rogers",Beaver and Aspen: Synergy Among Keystone Species,WAA Briefs,6,Not found,1 - 2,Not found,"In the West, climate change is likely to increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of drought. Restoration of soils and water storage capacity can help create resilient uplands and riverscapes (i.e., streams and the valley bottoms). Over the past two centuries, common land uses, the removal of beaver and wood, straightening of streams, and damage to riparian areas have created simplified, structurally starved, riverscapes. Degraded streams are very efficient at transporting water, sediment, and nutrients downstream. Aspen forests are also biological hotspots that have been degraded by past land uses such as overbrowsing ungulates, land clearing, fire suppression, and outright removal in favor of timber species. Loss of riverscape and aspen habitats has a disproportionate impact on biodiversity and landscape resilience. When aspen occur in or near riverscapes they are a preferred food and building material for beavers. Beaver, in-turn, can stimulate aspen regeneration, both through cutting and restoring hydrologic function in riparian areas. Adding beavers can reinstate riparian processes, increase aspen growth and diversity that extends to uplands, and buffer ecosystem sensitivity to extended drought.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8820&context=aspen_bib,Article,2019

(aspen) is an iconic species of the southwestern United States, where it is known for its extensive clonality. The size of clones and pattern of clonal distribution within and among stands can provide important clues to the species' evolution and ecology, but there are very few studies that have conducted the type of sampling necessary to define these features. We examined the genetic composition and habitat associations of aspen in a mixed-species forest in Cedar Breaks National Monument on the Markagunt Plateau, southwestern Utah. Genetic analysis of 94 stems ≥1 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) selected from a population census of 2742 stems within a contiguous 13.64-ha plot revealed 2 spatially cohesive triploid genets and 2 diploid genets (all differing in 8 to 15 alleles). Aspen abundance within the 13.64 ha varied between 0 and 634 stems/ha across 8 distinct habitat types. Regenerating aspen stems (1 cm ≤ dbh < 5 cm) varied between 0 and 112 stems/ha, with higher levels of regeneration in habitats with greater aspen dominance relative to other tree species. Recent regeneration may have been stimulated by a Dendroctonous rufipennis outbreak in the 1990s, which killed a high proportion of Picea engelmannii. Even though the visual impression is of a single aspen clone, the 4 identified genets suggest a higher-than-expected level of genetic diversity in this mixed-species stand which may confer resilience to increasing climate variability and drought. Furthermore, aspen regeneration in areas of both low and high adult aspen densities show that these mixed stands can support vigorous aspen populations.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3798&context=wild_facpub,Article,2019

We reviewed current knowledge regarding the effects of high temperatures and water deficits on post-fire recruitment processes of four major tree species (Picea mariana, Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides and Betula papyrifera) in order to anticipate the effects of climate change on forest recovery following fire in the boreal biome. We also produced maps of future vulnerability of post-fire recruitment by combining tree distributions in Canada with projections of temperature, moisture index and fire regime for the 2041–2070 and 2071–2100 periods. Although our review reveals that information is lacking for some regeneration stages, it highlights the response variability to climate conditions between species. The recruitment process of black spruce is likely to be the most affected by rising temperatures and water deficits, but more tolerant species are also at risk of being impacted by projected climate conditions. Our maps suggest that in eastern Canada, tree species will be vulnerable mainly to projected increases in temperature, while forests will be affected mostly by droughts in western Canada. Conifer-dominated forests are at risk of becoming less productive than they currently are, and eventually, timber supplies from deciduous species-dominated forests could also decrease. Our vulnerability maps are useful for prioritizing areas where regeneration monitoring efforts and adaptive measures could be developed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11056-019-09745-6,Article,2019

Understanding the relative importance of the many relevant factors over a large landscape could inform management strategies regarding aspen recruitment by focusing efforts on the most important factors. Therefore, between 2011 and 2016 we collected data on 29 biotic and abiotic factors thought to affect aspen recruitment from 92 randomly-selected aspen stands growing along the southwestern limit of its distribution in Arizona, USA. We assessed the condition of selected aspen stands by quantifying the number of recently recruited aspen stems (saplings >2 m tall and dbh) in each sampling plot. We used negative binomial regression to estimate the relationship between aspen recruitment and the measured covariates. We fit a balanced set of models, calculated AIC weights for those models, and summed the weights of the models containing each covariate as a measure of covariate relative importance. Six covariates had relative importance values that were significantly greater than random: fire severity in 2011, conifer encroachment, rust presence, fire severity in 2015, blight presence, and the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index. There were no significant differences in the ranking of these six covariates by relative importance. Although we estimated that cattle and elk had a significant negative impact on aspen recruitment, these factors were relatively unimportant. This seemingly counter-intuitive result arose because many sites lacked ungulates, but still failed to recruit aspen, indicating that other factors were more important for aspen recruitment. Our results indicate that conifer removal and increased fire activity could be among the most effective management tools to help promote aspen recruitment.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.03.026,Article,2019

These interactions are likely to change in the future through increasing permafrost thaw, more frequent and intense wildfires, and vegetation change from drought and competition. We utilize an individual tree-based vegetation model, the University of Virginia Forest Model Enhanced (UVAFME), to estimate current and future forest conditions across sites within interior Alaska. We updated UVAFME for application within interior Alaska, including improved simulation of permafrost dynamics, litter decay, nutrient dynamics, fire mortality, and postfire regrowth. Following these updates, UVAFME output on species-specific biomass and stem density was comparable to inventory measurements at various forest types within interior Alaska. We then simulated forest response to climate change at specific inventory locations and across the Tanana Valley River Basin on a 2 × 2 km2 grid. We derived projected temperature and precipitation from a five-model average taken from the CMIP5 archive under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Results suggest that climate change and the concomitant impacts on wildfire and permafrost dynamics will result in overall decreases in biomass (particularly for spruce (Picea spp.)) within the interior Tanana Valley, despite increases in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) biomass, and a resulting shift towards higher deciduous fraction. Simulation results also predict increases in biomass at cold, wet locations and at high elevations, and decreases in biomass in dry locations, under both moderate (RCP 4.5) and extreme (RCP 8.5) climate change scenarios. These simulations demonstrate that a highly detailed, species interactive model can be used across a large region within Alaska to investigate interactions between vegetation, climate, wildfire, and permafrost. The vegetation changes predicted here have the capacity to feed back to broader scale climate-forest interactions in the North American boreal forest, a region which contributes significantly to the global carbon and energy budgets.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8829&context=aspen_bib,Article,2019

However, the response of aspen to disturbance on reclaimed oil sands sites is not known. To determine the suckering and sprouting response of 6-year-old seedling origin aspen growing on a reclamation site, we destructively sampled 87 individual trees in May 2017. Trees were selected across two soil types, forest floor-mineral mix and peat-mineral mix, and three height classes, 100–199 cm, 200–299 cm, and > 300 cm. In August 2017, we returned to each cut tree to assess the type (sucker vs. stump sprout) and abundance of regeneration. Aspen readily responded to disturbance; however, responses were highly variable between trees, ranging from zero to 47 suckers and zero to 42 sprouts. Trees growing on peat-mineral mix were 7.8 times more likely to produce at least one sucker and generally had a higher abundance of suckers. Tree height was also positively correlated with suckering probability and abundance, while competition from surrounding vegetation decreased the probability and abundance of suckering, especially when cover of competing species was greater than 52.5%. The probability of stump sprouting was not affected by soil type or tree size, but did decrease with increases in tree competition. Overall, trembling aspen respond vigorously to disturbances on mine reclamation sites which is a promising sign of resilience for these novel and young ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11056-018-09698-2,Article,2019

Historical photographs and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) ages indicate that a high-severity fire historically burned at multiple high-elevation subalpine plots in today’s Village of Taos Ski Valley, with large high-severity patches (>640 ha). Low-severity, frequent (9–29-year median interval) surface fires burned on the south aspects in nearby lower elevation dry conifer forests in all watersheds. Fires were associated with drought during the fire year. Widespread fires commonly burned synchronously in multiple watersheds during more severe drought years, preceded by wet years, including fire in all three watersheds in 1664, 1715, and 1842.

Stand structure is likely to influence survival probability since it will lead to differences in competition intensity and in resource utilization. We examined relationships among stand age (years after stand establishment), age structure (age diversity), and tree size diversity (i.e., diversity of diameter classes), using cores collected from 531 aspen trees in 18 stands distributed across the province of Alberta, Canada. Results show positive relationships between stand age, age diversity, and tree size diversity. Logistic mixed effects survival probability models were developed using data from 199 remeasured permanent sample plots. Results show an inverted U-shaped relationship between survival probability and tree diameter. Survival probability trends varied between young (≤60), mature (>60 and ≤ 100), and old (>100) age groups in relation to differences in competition intensity and stand structure. Intraspecific competition (deciduous basal area larger) was negatively related to tree survival and the magnitude of the negative impact was stronger in the young age group. Negative effects of structural diversity (tree size diversity) on survival probability were strongest in the mature age group. We suggest that effects of tree size diversity relate to environmental stresses and competition at the stand level while the influence of deciduous basal area larger serves as a measure of competition experienced by individual trees. The significance of mean annual temperature in our models indicates that, under warmer conditions, competition variables (e.g., deciduous basal area larger and tree size diversity) had stronger effects on tree mortality with the magnitude of effects varying between age groups.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.02.003,Article,2019

I examine Diamond's typology and causal process tracing in the context of a case study concerning the dynamics of wolf and deer populations on the Kaibab Plateau in the 1920s, a case that has been used as a canonical example of a trophic cascade by ecologists but which has also been subject to controversy. I argue that ecologists have profitably deployed causal process tracing together with other types of experiment to help settle questions of causality in this case.

Although aspen are not drought-adapted, aspen are well adapted to wildfire. Increases in wildfire severity and extent as a result of climate change may provide opportunities for aspen regeneration, especially at mid- and high-elevation sites. Aspen's sensitivity to drought suggests that regeneration following fire might be constrained to cooler and wetter topographic locations on the landscape which reduce drought stress on vegetation. While aspen mortality is demonstrated to occur at low elevation sites, aspen establishment and persistence is known to occur at high elevation sites due to cooler, wetter conditions. Low- and high-elevation aspen persistence is well-understood; however, patterns of aspen regeneration and persistence at mid-elevation sites is still relatively unexplored. We use the 2002 Hayman fire (Colorado, USA) to explore whether high-severity wildfire has provided opportunities for aspen regeneration at mid-elevations in which aspen was not observed before the fire. If regeneration has occurred, we ask if regeneration is contingent on topographic conditions. Cool, wet microclimates created by fine-scale topography at mid-elevations may allow for increased aspen regeneration, however this is unexplored in the Hayman landscape. Our findings demonstrate that the Hayman fire provided opportunities for aspen regeneration at mid-elevation sites in which aspen were not observed before the fire and that the density of regeneration is contingent on topography. Specifically, aspen regeneration is most dense at mid-elevations on steep slopes. Ecosystem management may focus on threats to aspen health and vigor (i.e. ungulate herbivory) on steep slopes at mid-elevations rather than at low-elevation sites.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8826&context=aspen_bib,Thesis/Dissertation,2019

While contemporary experimental research programs seek to determine the short-term impacts of intensive residue removal on soil conditions and site productivity, rotation-length implications in operational settings remain speculative. Nonetheless, it is generally recognized that the effects of residue recovery are cover type and site dependent, and that production lands will be the primary source of increased utilization. We leveraged historical records across a 40-year chronosequence of 46 individual Populus spp. stands in upper Michigan harvested with Whole-tree harvest (WTH) and Stem-only harvest (STH) to observe and evaluate these practices on aboveground productivity and soil chemical properties. Stands were located across 4 contrasting soil types that are typical of site productivity and textural classes within the Great Lakes region. Results indicate a 36% reduction of residues in WTH treatments at 15.04 Mg ha−1 compared with 23.43 Mg ha−1 at stand establishment, yet residue levels in both treatments exceeded regional biomass retention guidelines, and differences were negligible by 16 years.

However, changing ungulate herbivory regimes may be altering recruitment success and resilience of aspen forests. The objective of this observational study was to quantify the impacts of ungulate herbivory on aspen recruitment potential. We sampled 36 aspen dominant stands on the Fishlake National Forest in Utah for browse of apical meristems, suckering density (< 180 cm in height), and recruitment density (≥ 180 cm). Our analysis indicated that for each 10% of apical meristems browsed, annualvertical and radial growth rates and recruitment density were reduced by 1.2 cm, 0.02 mm, and 17 ha− 1, respectively. In contrast, aspen suckering density increased by 1 230 suckers ha− 1, with each 10% browse of apical meristems. This suggests that ungulates contribute to aspen suckers persisting in the understory for longer periods and may alter recruitment success of aspen stands. Aspen that were under high ungulate browse pressure were associated with lower growth rates and persisted for twice as long in the understory. For example, a 5-yr-old sucker was predicted to be 115 cm without browse of apical meristems and 60 cm with 100% browse of apical meristems. Further, aspens of the same height with 100% browse of apical meristems were nearly 4 yr older on average than aspens with no evidence of browse of apical meristems. Approximately 34% of aspen suckers had persisted in the understory < 100 cm for ≥ 6 yr, and 7% of suckers had persisted in the understory for ≥ 10 yr. Our results suggest that high rates of meristem removal are correlated with increased aspen suckering yet reduced aspen growth and recruitment.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2018.12.006,Article,2019

This study was designed to assess the overall health of the Smith Falls aspen population and determine whether individual stands (n = 10) differed in condition, whether these differences in condition were related to environmental or demographic variables, and whether the condition of the stands was worsening. We found evidence of a declining aspen population, with crown loss and limb dieback documented across all size classes and worsening over a period of two y. Trees from younger, smaller size classes displayed less damage than older, larger ones, but accrued more damage over the two-y interval.

In many regions, aspen can maintain canopy dominance for decades to centuries as the sole major broadleaf trees in forested landscapes otherwise dominated by conifers. Aspen ecosystems are valued for many reasons, but here we highlight their potential as key contributors to regional and global biodiversity. We begin with an overview of the aspens’ ecological and economic roles. We then present a systematic literature analysis to assess topics of aspen study and how they differ by species and geographic region. We present global trends in research priorities, strengths, and weaknesses with the intention of bolstering a unified approach to aspen science and conservation. The body of this review consists of regional explorations of key aspen uses, threats, and research priorities with an eye toward developing strategies for research sharing and conservation practice. In that vein, we examine research gaps or areas in need of improved science resources by geographic location. Based on this global review of aspen research, we argue for the advancement of the “mega-conservation” strategy, centered on the idea of sustaining a set of common keystone communities (aspen) that support wide arrays of obligate species. This strategy contrasts with conventional preservation which focuses limited resources on individual species residing in narrow niches. Common threats to thriving aspen ecosystems include effects of herbivory, land clearing, logging practices favoring conifer species, and projected climate warming. Multi-scale research is needed that incorporates climatic variability with disturbance and how ecological, physiological, and genetic variability determine recruitment success in aspen. This review is intended to place aspen systems in a global conservation context by focusing on the many scientific advances taking place in these biologically diverse systems.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1095&context=eco_pubs,Article,2019

These forests harbor relatively high species diversity, yet are threatened by fire suppression, land development, timber-focused management, extended droughts, and chronic herbivory. “Pando” is a high-profile quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest in Utah, USA which is putatively the ‘largest living organism on earth.’ Pando comprises an estimated 47,000 genetically identical stems, but is threatened by human impacts. Our interest in the present study is whether changes to the giant organism were affecting understorey vegetation and whether discrete zones are displaying divergent community compositions. For instance, recent research has demonstrated strong herbivory impacts that are affecting portions of Pando differentially. This study consists of 20 randomly distributed vegetation survey plots within three de facto management regimes (hereafter, management group or type) along an herbivory protection gradient: No Fence, 2013 Fence (total protection), and 2014 Fence (imperfect protection). The plant survey was supplemented by previously-established forest and herbivore measurements to test for community assemblage explanatory agents. Sixty-eight species were found across the entire study. Analyses indicated strong links between management group orientation, species assemblages, and tree density/canopy openings. We found distinct evidence that within management group species composition was more similar than across groups for two of the three pairings. However, the other pairing, the most successfully protected area and the completely unprotected area, was not statistically distinct; likely a result a deteriorating overstorey in these two areas, whereas the third management type (2014 Fence) exhibited higher canopy cover. Indicator species analysis found that a small group of plant species had statistical allegiances to specific management groups, suggesting resource preference selection within Pando. Ordination analysis searching for causal factors reached two broad conclusions: (1) aspen regeneration, and therefore long-term resilience, is being negatively affected by chronic animal browsing and (2) current understorey species diversity is highest where forest canopy gaps are abundant.

The aim of this study was to assess the suitability of using winter harvesting in a provincial park as a way to mitigate severe soil compaction and ensure sufficient aspen regeneration to rejuvenate the mature forest. Six harvested blocks were selected for this study based on a skidder traffic intensity map, which was generated using GPS data collected throughout the duration of the harvesting event. Soil bulk density, aspen regeneration, and vegetation indices were measured across the different levels of skidder traffic intensity. Soil bulk density increased significantly following as little as 1–5 skidder passes (1.39 g cm−3) compared to the unharvested control (1.29 g cm−3); however, bulk density remained relatively constant as the level of skidder traffic intensity continued to increase. No relationship was found between soil bulk density and the level of aspen regeneration; however, the level of skidder traffic intensity significantly influenced the level of aspen regeneration. Aspen root collar diameter, leaf area index, dry leaf biomass, total N, and total P all decreased as the level of skidder traffic intensity increased; but, these decreases were not significant. Conversely, both aspen sucker density and height decreased significantly as the level of skidder traffic intensity increased, decreasing nearly 50% and 28%, respectively, in areas with 51–100 skidder passes. Multispectral remote sensing using UAV to assess the level of aspen regeneration across an entire harvested block proved ineffective. Although several vegetation indices showed significant relationships with aspen properties, none of these relationships had a coefficient of determination greater than approximately 0.2. Overall, winter harvesting appeared to have mitigated soil compaction concerns as expressed by soil bulk density and. although areas with higher levels of skidder traffic intensity (51–100 passes) experienced a decrease in aspen regeneration vigor, these areas with decreased aspen regeneration only accounted for approximately 1–2% of harvested blocks.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.01.017,Article,2019

Aspen (Populus spp.) are generally considered seral throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including P. tremuloides, the most widely distributed tree species in North America. Recent declines in aspen populations have occurred, especially along drought‐sensitive margins of its range and where fire exclusion and herbivory have promoted community transition. However, aspen also forms stable stands, and examination of the mechanisms that influence persistence can offer conservation insights, especially where populations are vulnerable to changing climate or altered disturbance dynamics. We sampled tree age and stand characteristics of isolated aspen forests in the arid Great Basin (USA) to determine if (1) aspen communities are more fire‐dependent and seral or fire‐independent and stable; (2) ungulate browsing inhibits aspen stability; and (3) temporal patterns of vegetative reproduction (i.e., ramet establishment or “suckering”) are correlated with climate. Aspen size and age class densities strongly fit negative exponential distributions, whether grouped geographically or by functional type, suggesting landscape‐scale persistence. Continuous age distributions and high proportions of recruitment‐sized to overstory trees suggest stability at stand scales, with exceptions including stands with higher browsing pressure. Few stands had evidence of fire, and relationships between dead tree size and variability in live tree size suggest a lack of fire dependency.

In North America, sudden aspen decline (SAD) is a growing concern that marks the rapid decline of quaking aspen trees leading to mortality at the stand and landscape scale. Research suggests that drought and water stress are the primary causes of SAD. Predisposing factors (age, structure, and landscape position), as well as associated stressors (i.e., pests and pathogens), have been linked to mortality in affected stands. The conflation of multiple interacting factors across the aspen’s broad geographic range in North America has produced significant debate over the classification of SAD as a disease and the proper management of affected stands. Interestingly, no such effects have been reported for the Eurasian aspen. We here review and synthesize the growing body of literature for North America and suggest that SAD is a novel decline disease resulting from multiple inciting and interacting factors related to climate, land-use history, and successional dynamics. We suggest that the range of aspen observed at the onset of the 21st Century was bolstered by a wet period in western North America that coincided with widespread regional cutting and clearing of late-successional forests for timber and grazing. No comparable land-use history, successional status, or age-class structure is apparent or linked for Eurasian forests. Eurasian aspen is either absent or young in managed forests, or old and decadent in parks in Fenno-Scandinavia, or it grows more intimately with a more diverse mixture of tree species that have arisen from a longer period of frequent timber cutting in Russia. Based on these insights we provide recommendations for practical management techniques that can promote stand resilience and recovery across a range of stand conditions in North America. Managers should attempt to identify SAD-prone stands using the presence of predisposing conditions and focus treatments such as coppice or prescribed fire on stands with suitable topographies, elevations, and climates. We conclude that SAD will persist throughout the coming decades, given the enormity of past cutting history, fire exclusion, and current changes in climate until a more active restoration agenda is implemented.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8822&context=aspen_bib,Article,2019

This study is the first to characterize the influence of fire-related vegetation changes on boreal predatory hymenopteran assemblages. We compare the abundance, species richness, and composition of predatory hymenopteran assemblages among forests at different stages of succession and of varying post-fire tree species compositions. Ant assemblages were weakly related to forest composition, but ants were significantly more abundant and speciose in early-successional forests than in mid-late successional forests. In contrast, macropterous wasp morphospecies richness and abundance, and micropterous wasp abundance, were positively related to the basal area of aspen, but were not related to successional stage.

Based on our synthesis, we suggest conceptual frameworks for assessing landscape conditions and determining areas that may be the highest priorities for tree planting to avoid persistent loss of conifer forests. Field studies have shown that some large patches of high severity burn can have relatively low levels of natural regeneration, especially among desired pine species. The accumulation of fuels and competition with shrubs and resprouting hardwoods may hinder the reestablishment of mature conifer trees. However, severe fires could also play a restorative role, by promoting non-conifer forested communities, such as meadows, shrubfields, and open forests with significant hardwood components. Such communities were historically rejuvenated and maintained by fire but have been replaced by conifer forest due in part to fire suppression. Reforestation in such areas may run counter to restoring ecological function and the ecosystem services that are provided by non-conifer communities. Through this framework, managers and stakeholders may better understand the contexts in which planting and passive recovery may better support ecological restoration.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11056-018-9675-z,Article,2019

Fires burn extensive areas in Canada, disturbing an average of 1.96 Mha yr−1, primarily in the boreal zone. Fires generally occur every ~30 – > 200 years in this region, due in part to a lack of fuel that allows young stands to resist reburning. Boreal understory plants and trees are adapted to stand-renewing wildfire through mechanisms such as serotiny, seed banking, and resprouting from roots and rhizomes of top-killed individuals. Such adaptations confer resilience to boreal forests, and post-fire vegetation communities generally resemble the pre-fire ones, following a stand self-replacement trajectory. Recently, the area burned, average fire size, and fire season length in northwestern Canada have increased. Severe fire weather has enabled reburning of young forests at very short intervals (sometimes ≤ 10 years between fires). Such changes in fire regime appear to be driven by anthropogenic climate change and increasingly severe fire weather. Furthermore, increasing moisture stress is implicated in simultaneous increases in fire activity, and worsening conditions for post-fire establishment of trees. Shifts in fire regime characteristics, such as burn severity and fire-free interval may lead to changes in vegetation composition following fire, thwarting stand self-replacement expectations.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8821&context=aspen_bib,Thesis/Dissertation,2019

However, following the 1995–96 reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus), completing the park’s large predator guild, young aspen in various portions of the northern range began to increase in height. From 1999 to 2015, a 17-yr period of declining elk densities in the northern range, browsing rates declined and young aspen heights increased once elk densities dropped below ∼4 elk/km2. The inverse relationship between browsing rate and young aspen height, a relationship linking elk and plants, was consistent with a re-established trophic cascade. Within the Glen Creek study area (8.3 km2), decreased browsing and increased heights of young aspen were associated, at least in part, with two hypothesized small-scale predation risk factors (i.e., escape impediment, view impediment). However, the young aspen height increases did not occur in the Mammoth study area (6.0 km2) and heights there remained short. With high levels of human activity at the Mammoth townsite, wolf activity near the townsite remained low, an example of “human shielding,” thereby allowing elk browsing to continue the suppression of young aspen. Overall, results indicated that Yellowstone’s contemporary large predator guild, by altering elk behavior and density at several spatial scales, has not only contributed to a relatively widespread pattern of increased young aspen heights across much of the park’s northern range, but also greater spatial variation in those heights.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.01.055,Article,2018

As predicted by population models, the rapid recovery of a wolf population caused both temporal and spatial variability in wolf–ungulate interactions that likewise generated temporal and spatial variation in the expression of trophic cascades. This has amplified spatial variation in vegetation in Yellowstone, particularly with willow (Salix spp.) and cottonwood (Populus spp.) in riparian areas, with associated changes in food webs. Increasing influences of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), cougars (Puma concolor), and bison (Bison bison) are making what initially was predominantly an elk–wolf interaction into an increasingly complex system. Outside Yellowstone, however, humans have a dominant influence in western North America that overwhelms trophic cascades resulting in what appear to be bottom-up influences on community structure and function. Complex and unexpected ecosystem responses to wolf recovery in Yellowstone reinforce the value of national parks and other protected areas as ecological baseline reserves.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyy115,Article,2018

Numerous studies in boreal Alaska have concluded that growth of black and white spruce is declining as a result of temperature‐induced drought stress. The combined evidence of declining spruce growth and changes in the fire regime that favor establishment of deciduous tree species has led some investigators to suggest the region may be transitioning from dominance by spruce to dominance by deciduous forests and/or grasslands. Although spruce growth trends have been extensively investigated, few studies have evaluated long‐term radial growth trends of the dominant deciduous species (Alaska paper birch and trembling aspen) and their sensitivity to moisture availability. We used a large and spatially extensive sample of tree cores from interior Alaska to compare long‐term growth trends among contrasting tree species (white and black spruce vs. birch and aspen). All species showed a growth peak in the mid‐1940s, although growth following the peak varied strongly across species. Following an initial decline from the peak, growth of white spruce showed little evidence of a trend, while black spruce and birch growth showed slight growth declines from ~1970 to present. Aspen growth was much more variable than the other species and showed a steep decline from ~1970 to present. Growth of birch, black and white spruce was sensitive to moisture availability throughout most of the tree‐ring chronologies, as evidenced by negative correlations with air temperature and positive correlations with precipitation. However, a positive correlation between previous July precipitation and aspen growth disappeared in recent decades, corresponding with a rise in the population of the aspen leaf miner (Phyllocnistis populiella), an herbivorous moth, which may have driven growth to a level not seen since the early 20th century. Our results provide important historical context for recent growth and raise questions regarding competitive interactions among the dominant tree species and exchanges of carbon and energy in the warming climate of interior Alaska.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2223,Article,2018

In this study, we devised two different modes of simulated herbivory, representing a selective ungulate feeding strategy (defoliation: leaf tissue removal only) and a bulk feeding strategy (clipping: leaves, twigs and meristems taken together). We applied these contrasting herbivory treatments to juvenile aspen suckers (Populus tremuloides Michx.) regenerating underneath aspen stands in early summer (June), late summer (August) or at both times to determine the effects of herbivory mode, timing and frequency on regenerating aspen. In response to the simulated herbivory treatments, we measured traits related to three plant defense strategies: tolerance (aboveground biomass and stem diameter), resistance (foliar phenolic glycosides) and vertical escape (sucker height and average leader length). There was no evidence that mode, timing or frequency of simulated herbivory induced or repressed phenolic glycoside production. Early summer herbivory was more detrimental than late summer herbivory on aspen tolerance and escape. Repeat herbivory in late summer did not amplify the negative effects of early summer herbivory. Clipping and defoliation tended to have similar effects on tolerance but clipping was more detrimental than defoliation on vertical escape. These results suggest that different ungulate herbivore species may have disparate impacts on the plant communities by selecting different tissues of the same plant, or browsing the plant at different times in the growing season.",https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy071,Article,2018

In 2014 we established three experimental gardens along a temperature/elevation gradient to test the implications of shifting temperatures on tree function. Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings from a mid-elevation population were established in all three gardens and leaves were sampled monthly during the 2017 growing season. From these, we quantified the magnitude and timing of osmotic regulation, the relationships between leaf osmotic potential (Ψosm), midday leaf water potential (Ψmid), and soil moisture conditions under different temperature regimes, and growth efficiency (change in basal area/growing day). We observed a strong relationship between Ψosm and soil moisture, and a strong seasonal decline in Ψosm at the warmest and intermediate sites while the coldest site experienced a later increase in osmolytes associated with the highest degree of freeze tolerance. Growth efficiency was highest at the intermediate-temperature site – closest in elevation to the seed source location – but declined asymmetrically with warming or cooling.

Results indicated that the influence of drought on forest decline was stronger than insect outbreaks, although both had significant effects. Furthermore, the influence of drought and insect outbreaks showed spatiotemporal variability.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of fire on nutrient dynamics in soil and water in peatlands and forested landscapes in the BP and relate this to aspen regeneration. Nutrient concentrations, nutrient supply rates, and net nutrient mineralization rates were determined in burned and unburned sections of a peatland and forest and compared with the regeneration of aspen. NO3−, NH4+, and P varied spatially throughout the landscape, and differences were observed between peatland and upland areas. In general, differences in nutrient dynamics were not observed between burned and unburned areas, with the exception of P. Nutrient and growth data suggest that aspen do not require nutrient‐rich conditions for regeneration and instead relied on forest litter to satisfy nutrient demands. Although the peatlands contained high nutrients, aspen did not flourish in the combination of anoxic and aerobic organic‐rich soils present in this area. Although aspen may use peat water and nutrients through their rooting zones, peatlands are unsuitable for aspen re‐establishment in the long‐term.

How these phenological shifts will affect herbivory will depend on temporal patterns of foliar traits that occur during leaf expansion, and their effects on folivore performance. Through fine-scale time series sampling of newly flushed trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) foliage, we observed a previously unknown peak in phenolic glycoside concentrations that coincides with the emergence of sensitive neonates of gypsy moths and rapidly declines soon after bud break. The magnitude and duration of the initial post-bud break peak in phenolic glycosides varied substantially among genotypes. In contrast, foliar nitrogen concentrations declined at a more uniform rate among genotypes throughout leaf expansion. In addition, leaf toughness remained uniformly low throughout these periods of phytochemical change, and did not rise or vary substantially among genotypes until after anticipated windows of climate change-induced shifts between bud break and egg hatch had elapsed. Controlled manipulation of intervals between gypsy moth egg hatch and aspen bud break generated differences in larval performance among hatch cohorts and host genotypes that corresponded with changes in foliar phenolic glycoside and nitrogen concentrations. These findings indicate that the effects of climate change-induced phenological shifts on herbivory will differ among host plant genotypes, and that genetic variation in foliar chemical patterns will strongly influence this heterogeneity.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4160-0,Article,2018

Feedbacks between vegetation and fire may modify the direct effects of warming on fire activity and shape ecological responses to changing fire frequency. We investigate these interactions using extensive field data from the Boreal Shield of Saskatchewan, Canada, a region where >40% of the forest has burned in the past 30 years. We use geospatial and field data to assess the resistance and resilience of eight common vegetation states to frequent fire by quantifying the occurrence of short‐interval fires and their effect on recovery to a similar vegetation state. These empirical relationships are combined with data from published literature to parameterize a spatially explicit, state‐and‐transition simulation model of fire and forest succession. We use this model to ask if and how: (a) feedbacks between vegetation and wildfire may modify fire activity on the landscape, and (b) more frequent fire may affect landscape forest composition and age structure. Both field and GIS data suggest the probability of fire is low in the initial decades after fire, supporting the hypothesis that fuel accumulation may exert a negative feedback on fire frequency. Field observations of pre‐ and postfire composition indicate that switches in forest state are more likely in conifer stands that burn at a young age, supporting the hypothesis that resilience is lower in immature stands. Stands dominated by deciduous trees or jack pine were generally resilient to fire, while mixed conifer and well‐drained spruce forests were less resilient. However, simulation modeling suggests increased fire activity may result in large changes in forest age structure and composition, despite the feedbacks between vegetation–fire likely to occur with increased fire activity.",https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14550,Article,2018

The foodscape was affected by elevation and canopy height but it did not explain aspen use or indicators of aspen resilience. Our findings suggest that foodscapes of lower nutrient content–occurring at lower elevations under drier climatic conditions–are more likely to foster aspen stands with less forb and grass understory, and thus lower nutritional biomass.

Here, we estimated the nucleotide variation in Populus davidiana, a widespread species distributed in Eurasia. Three groups in northeast, central, and southwest China were constructed according to the simulation results from SAMOVA, composition of chloroplast haplotypes and structure results. We revealed that the northeast China had endemic haplotypes, the haplotypes and nucleotide diversity in northern regions were not lower than that in southern China, and this species has not experienced population expansion base on the estimation of Bayesian skyline plots. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) indicated that the northeast China had a high suitability score during the last glacial maximum. The combined evidence clearly demonstrated that northeastern and southwestern refugia were maintained across the current distributional range of P. davidiana during the LGM. The genetic differentiation between these two refugia might be mainly caused by differences of climate among these areas.

After disturbance, clonal aspen stands quickly achieve canopy closure by sending up numerous clonal shoots (root suckers) from their lateral root system. Controlled aboveground disturbance will commonly induce prolific root suckering and thereby increase stem density in clonal aspen stands, but it is unclear if increases in stem density will be observed in planted seedling-origin aspen stands. The objectives of this study were to determine (1) overall root suckering response of planted aspen to aboveground disturbance; (2) if different cut heights of the stem or infliction of root damage impact the number of root suckers produced. We found that planted aspen regenerated readily after disturbance, averaging five root suckers per cut tree. However, individual response was highly variable, ranging from zero to 29 root suckers per root system. Of the cut trees, 75% produced at least one root sucker and 60% produced at least one stump sprout. Cutting trees close to the soil surface produced more root suckers than leaving a 25 cm stump. While root system size (mass and length) was well correlated with aboveground measures of planted aspen, root suckering was not related to root system size.

The relief on this map reflects, for example, places that an animal avoids to minimize risk. Although the LOF concept is a potentially unifying theme in ecology that is often invoked to explain the ecological and conservation significance of fear, little is known about the daily dynamics of an LOF. Despite theory and data to the contrary, investigators often assume, implicitly or explicitly, that an LOF is a static consequence of a predator's mere presence within an ecosystem. We tested the prediction that an LOF in a large‐scale, free‐living system is a highly dynamic map with “peaks” and “valleys” that alternate across the diel (24‐h) cycle in response to daily lulls in predator activity. We did so with extensive data from the case study of Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolves (Canis lupus) that was the original basis for the LOF concept. We quantified the elk LOF, defined here as spatial allocation of time away from risky places and times, across nearly 1,000‐km2 of northern Yellowstone National Park and found that it fluctuated with the crepuscular activity pattern of wolves, enabling elk to use risky places during wolf downtimes. This may help explain evidence that wolf predation risk has no effect on elk stress levels, body condition, pregnancy, or herbivory. The ability of free‐living animals to adaptively allocate habitat use across periods of high and low predator activity within the diel cycle is an underappreciated aspect of animal behavior that helps explain why strong antipredator responses may trigger weak ecological effects, and why an LOF may have less conceptual and practical importance than direct killing.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&context=eco_pubs,Article,2018

Overyielding, indicating higher productivity in mixtures than in monocultures, has been observed in mature stands but has not been examined in young stands (old) in this region. We used data collected between 2006 and 2015 at 7 locations in Alberta and Saskatchewan for the Western Boreal Growth and Yield Association (WESBOGY) Long Term Study to examine whether overyielding occurs in young mixtures of these species and to identify factors (species composition, stand density, tree size, species proportion, site quality, and climate) that influence overyielding. Our results show that overyielding is occurring in these young boreal mixedwood stands in western Canada. Relative productivity total (RPT), indicating mixing effect (RPT > 1 indicates overyielding), varies from 0.921 to 1.537 among mixedwood treatments, and thinned aspen stands show higher production than unthinned aspen stands. Initial stand density (basal area) and initial aspen size (QMD at the start of the measurement interval) positively influence mixing effect while initial spruce size (QMD) negatively influences mixing effect. The magnitude of overyielding declines with increasing growing season length (DD5) and the relative productivity of aspen decreases with increasing site quality. Species mixtures support higher stocking than pure stands due to differences in growth rate and shade tolerance of the two species. Tree size is also important since productivity will decline when two species compete with each other for space and resources. Consequently, a mixed species stand that has space partitioning and size inequality between species, which reduces competition and favours expression of the functional traits (e.g., shade tolerance) of each species, tends to have better productivity.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.09.053,Article,2018

Topography is an important factor in snowpack accumulation and ablation as it influences exposure to solar radiation and atmospheric conditions. Few direct measurements of post-fire snowpack have been taken and none to this date that evaluate how topographical aspect influences the effect of forest fire on snowpack accumulation and ablation. We set up a two-year experiment on the Twitchell Canyon fire in south-central Utah on both north and south facing aspects and burned and unburned forest conditions across three replicated blocks. There was a significant interaction between burn condition and aspect for snow depth in which there was a reduction in snow depth in burned areas on south facing aspects but not on northern facing aspects. Snowpack disappeared earlier in burned areas than unburned areas, particularly on south facing slopes. Snow water equivalence (SWE) did not vary between burned and unburned forest.

Cavity-nesting birds provide an interesting test case. They compete aggressively for resources and experience low nest predation rates, which might predict dispersion, but across 19 years of study we found that they commonly aggregate by sharing nest trees. Tree sharing was more common when aspen were more abundant and was somewhat more common in years with higher nest predation risk. Nest success was higher in shared trees when nest predation risk was higher than average.

As the dominant deciduous tree in Western North American forests, aspen plays a critical role in forest biodiversity and ecosystem function. Therefore, the persistence of this species under changing climate patterns is a topic of critical concern; especially where aspen exists toward the vulnerable margin of its range. This study set out to investigate the associations of atmospheric, hydrologic, edaphic and topographic variables with physiological drought stress in aspen. The study took place on the Zumwalt Prairie in northeastern Oregon, a semi-arid bunchgrass prairie where aspen occur in isolated stands associated with riparian areas and late-season persistence of snow drifts. Using a 33-year time series of landsat imagery to detect associations of aspen stands late-season snow cover and field measurements of soil moisture in aspen stands during 2017, we found while snow dominated stands were associated with greater soil moisture during spring, levels had equilibrated to those of other upland stands by summer. Measurements of predawn and midday stem water potential in multiple height classes of aspen ramets revealed associations of both shallow soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit with physiological drought stress in aspen. Analysis of soil texture class revealed an important association with midday stem water potential, with finer textured soils associated with somewhat higher midday drought stress than coarser textured soils. While neither topographical characteristics nor snow cover were found to be important drivers of drought stress, topographical curvature was found to have a strong influence on summer soil moisture in upland stands. These findings contribute to our understanding of aspen physiology, drought ecology and landscape hydrology toward the xeric margin of aspen’s range. This information can help land managers to anticipate and adapt to changing climates and understand their effects on key plant species such as aspen.",https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/2f75rf15g,Thesis/Dissertation,2018

Soils are reconstructed during reclamation to provide a foundation and a nutrient source for the novel ecosystems. However, reclamation is often monitored through structural indicators of soil quality, which may not reflect dynamic ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling. Our objective was to determine if nutrient cycling was occurring on novel ecosystems and if standard structural measures of soil quality were appropriate indicators. We assessed soil quality and nitrogen cycling in reclaimed, harvested and undisturbed aspen forest sites following the addition of 15N-labelled aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) leaf litter to the soil surface. Structural soil quality indicators, including soil moisture and microbial carbon and nitrogen biomass, were higher on the undisturbed site, whereas soil microbial composition differed among sites. Yet, uptake of 15N by microbes and plants, which continued throughout the 52 mo field incubation, was comparable across all sites. These results indicate that differences in structural attributes between disturbed and undisturbed soils do not necessarily translate into differences in soil functioning related to nitrogen cycling. Instead, this case study supports exploring the use of stable isotope tracers to assess dynamic soil function indicators in reclaimed ecosystems. Being able to follow biogeochemical cycling as vegetation becomes established and new forests start to develop following reclamation is key to assessing the long-term sustainability of these novel ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2018-0021,Article,2018

This paper studies the marginal population characteristics and stand dynamics of aspen tree (Populus tremula L.) in natural, pure and mixed forest stands with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). These populations were observed on founding sites between Timarli Valley and Timan Plateau located in Pasinler in the Erzurum Province in Turkey.Materials and Methods: Three replicated sample sites were established according to a randomised block design with a spacing of approximately 200 m in altitude starting from 1,890 m, which is the natural distribution area of P. tremula, up to 2,460 m, above which this species can no longer thrive. Timarlı Valley, Pasinler Erzurum Province, which is the area of research, is located enroute to Timan Plateau, where Scots pines form the alpine tree line ranging up to 2,680 m a.s.l.Results: In this context, aspen trees in this region are the second closest tree species to the tree line after Scots pine, which are found in the subalpine and war zones. In addition, as a result of this study, it has been found out that this species, notwithstanding its natural area of occupancy across Turkey, could thrive up to 2,460 m in altitude and extent of occurrence.Conclusions: A new marginal natural population related to aspen has been found in Pasinler in the Erzurum Province, Turkey, which at the same time indicates that the timberline value in the vertical natural distribution of these species should be updated. Aspen trees, which as pioneer trees play a vital role in the rebuilding or restoring of the ecological balance in forests that over time become degraded because of excessive cutting of trees and erroneous silvicultural interventions should be used in the reclamation of broadleaved and mixed forests in a planned manner.

We compared aspen data from inside the park to data collected in three winter ranges outside the park. For most areas, the percentage of young aspen browsed annually was 80–100% in 1997–98, decreasing to 30–60% in 2011–15. Sapling recruitment was inversely correlated with browsing intensity, and increased despite climate trends unfavorable for aspen. Browsing decreased with decreasing elk density, a relationship suggesting that densities greater than about 4 elk/km2 resulted in consistently strong browsing effects likely to suppress aspen recruitment. Changes in elk density and distribution were influenced by predators, as well as human hunters. Most evidence for trophic cascades involving large terrestrial mammals has been from protected areas within national parks.

For both trembling aspen- and white birch-dominated residual stands, canopy transmittance exhibited a negative exponential relationship with basal area, density, and stand density index.

Both species excel in post-disturbance high-light environments, but lodgepole pine has generally been thought to establish poorly on undisturbed seedbeds, and aspen suckering may be inhibited by intact aspen overstory. We ask whether lodgepole pine and aspen will regenerate in sufficient quantities to revegetate these forests. We visited a random sample of aspen and lodgepole pine stands across the affected landscape in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming to measure regeneration and overstory mortality. Lodgepole pine regeneration is occurring in 85% of stands, and most stands have >550 stems ha−1. The median aspen sucker density was 6175 stems ha−1. Surprisingly, neither lodgepole pine nor aspen regeneration density was related to overstory mortality level. Animal damage is currently affecting aspen in these forests. Over 50% of stands had damage to 60% or more of their suckers, but 30% of stands had <20% of their stems damaged. Browsed stems were significantly shorter for their ages and were shorter than the 2.5-m height threshold for possible elk browsing. However, the results suggest that sufficient quantities of down lodgepole pine may protect aspen from damage and allow aspen to successfully recruit to the overstory. Multiple regression analysis showed that down lodgepole pine basal area, followed by browsing pressure, were the most important predictors of sucker height and the proportion of suckers browsed. Although 15% of stands had no lodgepole pine regeneration, aspen and lodgepole pine forests are generally regenerating despite animal browsing on aspen. This study is the first to present a regional perspective on regeneration in MPB-affected lodgepole pine and aspen forests, and overall, intervention does not seem necessary to ensure a mix of both species in the future.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8777&context=aspen_bib,Article,2018

Regeneration and Yield,Forest Science,64,4,442 - 451,Not found,"In Great Lakes aspen forests, clearcutting and whole-tree skidding (WTS) has been the usual practice. Soil disturbances from WTS sometimes lead to regeneration declines in areas of high equipment traffic. Advances in harvesting mechanization have resulted in increased utilization of cut-to-length (CTL) processing equipment, which can reduce site impact through placing harvest residues in operational corridors to spread surface load posed by equipment. While these practices may mitigate soil disturbance, heavy residue loads can decrease aspen regeneration. We sampled soil conditions and regeneration systematically, in transects perpendicular to CTL trails, and compiled metrics of residue loads, regeneration density and height, and soil characteristics to examine potential interactions. Our results indicate that residues are notably greater directly on the equipment trail when compared to adjacent areas, and that these trends correspond with a significant loss in regeneration height and density. Further, we observed a 186% increase in the stand area affected by CTL operations compared to those reported for WTS methods elsewhere. We projected these trends with growth and yield simulations, which suggest a reduction in timber yields at rotation age as compared to stands without explicit CTL equipment trails. These patterns may have unintended influences on effective stand regeneration and threaten short-term productivity and future yields.

The objective of this study was to examine the differential and combined effects of ungulate communities (deer, elk, and cattle) on aspen forest recruitment after fires that occurred in 2012. Eight sets of differential ungulate exclosures, monitored by camera traps, were established across three National Forests in Utah. We identified the differential effect of each of three ungulate species using fencing that allowed for deer-only, native ungulate only (deer and elk), all ungulates and a complete ungulate exclosure. Over a three year period (2013–2016) we quantified ungulate species impacts on aspen height, density, and browse rates using camera trap photos. Ungulate activity was nearly 10-fold higher in two National Forests compared to the third, and gradually decreased over time. Meristem removal by ungulates in unfenced plots across sites averaged 60% which we identified as a critical threshold point for aspen recruitment failure. All three ungulate species had significant and similar effects on aspen regeneration success, but when adjusted for differences in estimated forage intake (animal unit months), differential impacts became apparent (deer > elk > cattle). We estimated that 4 cattle per camera−1 day−1 and 2.5 deer or elk per camera−1 day−1 was sufficient to reach the critical recruitment threshold of 60% removal of apical meristems.

To achieve robust monitoring across variable landscapes, managers need quick and reliable indicators for assessing ungulate impacts. Our goal was to evaluate two direct (meristem removal, defoliation) and two indirect methods (fecal counts, camera counts) for evaluating ungulate activity on forest regeneration after fire. We examined the relationships between measures of browse activity (meristem removal, defoliation) of aspen with ungulate community estimates (fecal and camera counts) as a function of variation in physiographic conditions across the study sites. Measurements were made in belt transects at 28 sites across three fires that burned in National Forests in Utah in 2012. Aspen height was best predicted by a model with meristem removal, terrain ruggedness, aspect, and year. Mean aspen height was 5 cm lower for every 10% increase in meristem removal an effect that increased over time. We found moderate correlation between the year and percent defoliation interaction and aspen density. Percent defoliation was related to reduced aspen density in the 2nd and 3rd years but not in the 1st year. Results demonstrated that meristem removal is correlated closely with ocular estimates of defoliation (r2 = 0.83), ungulate abundance using fecal counts (r2 = 0.65) and camera counts (r2 = 0.63). Fecal counts and camera counts also correlated well with each other (r2 = 0.74).

Despite the importance for science and management communities, our ability to forecast tree mortality at landscape to continental scales is limited. However, two independent information streams have the potential to inform and improve mortality forecasts: repeat forest inventories and satellite remote sensing. Time series of tree‐level growth patterns indicate that productivity declines and related temporal dynamics often precede mortality years to decades before death. Plot‐level productivity, in turn, has been related to satellite‐based indices such as the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Here we link these two data sources to show that early warning signals of mortality are evident in several NDVI‐based metrics up to 24 years before death. We focus on two repeat forest inventories and three NDVI products across western boreal North America where productivity and mortality dynamics are influenced by periodic drought. These data sources capture a range of forest conditions and spatial resolution to highlight the sensitivity and limitations of our approach. Overall, results indicate potential to use satellite NDVI for early warning signals of mortality. Relationships are broadly consistent across inventories, species, and spatial resolutions, although the utility of coarse‐scale imagery in the heterogeneous aspen parkland was limited. Longer‐term NDVI data and annually remeasured sites with high mortality levels generate the strongest signals, although we still found robust relationships at sites remeasured at a typical 5 year frequency.

Extended drought, fire suppression, human development, and chronic herbivory serve to limit the sustainability of this keystone species. Here we assess conditions at a renowned quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) grove—purportedly the largest living organism on earth—with ramifications for aspen biogeography globally. The “Pando” clone is 43 ha and estimated to contain 47,000 genetically identical aspen ramets. This iconic forest is threatened in particular by herbivory, and current management activities aim to reverse the potential for type conversion, likely to a non-forest state. We set out to gauge agents affecting recent deterioration through a network of monitoring plots and by examining a chronosequence of historic aerial photos to better understand the timing of putative departure from a sustainable course. Sixty-five permanent forest monitoring plots were located in three management regimes existing within Pando: no fencing, fencing with active and passive treatments, fencing with passive-only treatment. At each sample plot we measured live and dead mature trees, stem recruitment and regeneration, forest and shrub cover, browse level, and feces counts as a surrogate for ungulate presence. Ordination results indicate that aspen regeneration was the strongest indicator of overall forest conditions at Pando, and that mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) presence strongly impacts successful regeneration. Additionally, fencing with active/passive treatments yielded the most robust regeneration levels; however, a fence penetrable by ungulates in the passive-only treatment most likely played a role in this outcome. The aerial photo sequence depicts various human intrusions over the past seven decades, but perhaps most telling, a decline in self-replacement beginning 30–40 years ago.

Future elevated atmospheric CO2concentrations are predicted to reduce nitrogen content and increase tannin concentrations in plant tissues, thus reducing litter quality for microbial communities and slowing decomposition rates. How the distinct condensed tannin fractions (water-soluble, acetone:MeOH-soluble and solvent-insoluble) impact soil processes, has not been investigated. We tested the impact of condensed tannin and nitrogen concentrations on decay rates of poplar and Douglas-fir litter at sites spanning temperature and moisture gradients in coastal rainshadow forests in British Columbia, Canada. The three condensed tannin fractions were quantified using recent improvements on the butanol-HCl assay. Decay was assessed based on carbon remaining, while changes in litter chemistry were primarily observed using two methods for proximate chemical analyses. After 0.6 and 1 year of decay, more carbon remained in poplar litter with high, compared to low, condensed tannin concentrations. By contrast, more carbon remained in Douglas fir litter than poplar litter during this period, despite lower condensed tannin concentrations. Rapid early decay was especially attributed to loss of soluble compounds, including water-soluble condensed tannins. Water-insoluble condensed tannin fractions, which were transformed to acid-unhydrolyzable residues over time, were associated with reduced carbon loss in high condensed tannin litter.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10533-017-0406-x,Article,2018

We took measurements prior to burning, the year of burning, and 1 year after burning in treatment areas and adjacent unburned control areas in winter and summer at 2 scales. At a fine scale, we used vegetation transects and pellet counts; at the landscape scale, we used Landsat imagery for vegetation and aerial survey flights for animals. Following prescribed fire, shrub cover declined and burned communities increased in herbaceous cover. Plant species diversity also declined but increased to almost that of unburned areas by 1 year after burning. Burning increased quality of forage most (2–7 percentage points more digestibility and 0.3–6.3 percentage points more crude protein than unburned areas) in the summer of the burn. In winter, forage biomass and available digestible dry matter increased to pre‐burn levels by 1 year after burning. Stone's sheep and elk always used burned areas more than unburned control areas in winter at both scales. Whereas elk used sites with higher forage quantity, Stone's sheep appeared to respond to forage quality at the fine scale. Ungulate grazing during the 2 years of this study did not alter forage quantity on burned or unburned sites, as determined from range exclosures. Based on our findings in this area, maximum benefits to elk would be achieved from large prescribed fires on south‐aspect slopes that result in the greatest amounts of forage biomass.

During surface mining, the vegetation is cleared, the topsoil is salvaged, and the overburden (the layer of sand and clay in between the topsoil and the oil sands) is piled (see Fig. 2 in Audet et al.1 for an explanation of the land-reclamation procedure). After mining is finished, the landforms (composed of overburden and tailings sand) are capped with organic matter-rich soil covers made of either upland-derived forest floor-mineral mix (FFMM) or a lowland-derived peat-mineral mix (PMM)2. Alberta’s oil sands deposits represent an economically viable proven reserve of about 166 billion barrels of crude bitumen covering 142,200 km2 of land in the boreal forest3. Among the three oil sands deposits in Alberta (Peace River, Cold Lake and Athabasca areas), surface mining is only possible in the Athabasca region. The surface mineable area represents a total of 4,750 km2, with 895 km2 of land already disturbed. Ecosystems affected by oil sands surface mining lose their ecological functions due to the disappearance of above- and below- ground species. It is, therefore, crucial to reclaim these areas using strategies that provide the best conditions for site recolonization in order to quickly reestablish a self-sustaining and functioning ecosystem.

Here, we investigated compounds from quaking aspen trees (Populus tremuloides) as potential antimicrobial agents. Several extractions using different solvents were realized, and corresponding antimicrobial activity was tested against eight microorganisms. Results revealed that polar extraction solvents including water, ethanol and methanol gave the best extraction yields (>15.07%). Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC) demonstrated that water extracts had the best antimicrobial activity by a weak to moderate inhibition of growth of all eight tested microorganisms in addition to having a bactericidal effect on three of them. The quaking aspen methanol extract also displayed antimicrobial activity but to a lower level than the water extract. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) analysis led to the identification of 92 compounds, mainly polyphenols in both extracts, with 22 molecules previously known for their antimicrobial properties. According to the relative abundance, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (5.44% in methanol extract) and kaempferol (5.03% in water extract) were the most abundant antimicrobial compounds.

While these changes are expected to disrupt the functioning of boreal forests, their ultimate implications for forest composition are uncertain. In particular, recent site‐level studies of the Alaskan boreal forest have reported both increases and decreases in productivity over the past few decades. Here, we test the idea that variations in Alaskan forest growth and mortality rates are contingent on species composition. Using forest inventory measurements and climate data from plots located throughout interior and south‐central Alaska, we show significant growth and mortality responses associated with competition, midsummer vapor pressure deficit, and increased growing season length. The governing climate and competition processes differed substantially across species. Surprisingly, the most dramatic climate response occurred in the drought tolerant angiosperm species, trembling aspen, and linked high midsummer vapor pressure deficits to decreased growth and increased insect‐related mortality. Given that species composition in the Alaskan and western Canadian boreal forests is projected to shift toward early‐successional angiosperm species due to fire regime, these results underscore the potential for a reduction in boreal productivity stemming from increases in midsummer evaporative demand.",https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13952,Article,2018

While most studies on trade‐offs between food acquisition and risk avoidance by ungulate prey species have been conducted in areas with limited human impact, carnivores are now increasingly returning to highly anthropogenic landscapes. Many of these landscapes are dominated by forestry, and ungulate‐forestry conflicts are an increasing issue. The aim of this study was to test if the indirect effects of a re‐colonizing large predator, the wolf Canis lupus, results in a change in browsing intensity by moose Alces alces in young forest plantations in a boreal forest in Sweden. We selected 24 different forest plantations, with 12 located in low‐wolf and 12 in high‐wolf utilization areas. In each plantation, we measured browsing intensity, tree height, tree density, distance to the closest forest edge and we counted the number of moose pellet groups. In contrast to our predictions, wolf utilization was not the main driver of moose browsing patterns. Instead, moose browsing intensity declined with tree density and height. Separate analyses on the main tree species showed that wolf utilization had an influence, but browsing intensity was in fact higher in the high‐wolf utilization areas for three out of five tree species. This pattern seemed to be driven by a strong confounding relationship between wolf utilization, tree density and height, which were both lower in the high‐wolf utilization areas. We argue that this confounding effect is due to wolves being pushed towards the less productive parts of the landscape away from human activity centers. Therefore, we concluded that in order to better understand carnivore driven risk‐mediated effects on herbivore behavior in anthropogenic landscapes we need to better understand the complexity of human–carnivore–prey‐ecosystem interactions.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.03329,Article,2018

Monitoring data to track changes in boreal forest bird populations are scarce. Therefore, we repeated surveys at historic research sites in aspen-dominated boreal mixedwood forest in central Saskatchewan, Canada, to test for changes in abundance in different forest age classes. We used GIS analyses and habitat data to test whether observed changes in abundance were correlated with within-stand changes in habitat over approximately 20 years. Eight of the ten species examined showed evidence for change in abundance. Trends from our study showed little correlation with regional trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and generally displayed greater magnitude and precision. Species associated with closed-canopy forests declined more rapidly than suggested by BBS surveys, whereas species associated with disturbance generally had opposite trends to the BBS. Decreased abundance of species such as Swainson’s Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) and Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata) correlated with loss of forest cover from fire or harvesting. Conversely, changes in the abundance of species associated with early successional forest and canopy gaps were primarily correlated with within-stand disturbances (e.g., Magnolia Warbler [Setophaga magnolia]) and changes in the proportion of the stands composed of conifers (e.g., White-throated Sparrow [Zonotrichia albicollis]). We suggest repeating historic surveys and comparing trends with other monitoring programs to provide a weight-of-evidence approach to assess overall support for changes in species’ status for regions where data are sparse. Our results are consistent with previous studies that predict that changes in the forest age-class distribution could alter boreal forest bird abundance and community composition.

In response, variable retention (VR) harvest has been increasingly promoted as a landscape-based approach to enhance sustainability by maintaining biodiversity and other ecosystem functions in managed forests. Although the success of the VR approach depends on post-harvest stand dynamics, little is known about growth and mortality of residual trees after harvest and how such trees respond to interactions between amount of retention and tree or site level covariates. We use data from three censuses distributed over a 10-year period of the main merchantable species to study the effects of retention level (i.e., percent of trees retained), mixedwood cover type, tree species, and three tree or terrain covariates (tree stem diameter, percent live crown, and soil wetness) on survival and growth of residual trees in a retention harvest experiment in NW Alberta, Canada. Both mortality and growth of residual trees were negatively related to retention levels. During the first five-year period after harvest, effects of retention levels on mortality were more evident for white spruce (Picea glauca) than for Populus spp., but effects on growth were weaker for white spruce. Tree mortality decreased through time following VR harvest for all species and in most cover types, while trends in tree growth varied by species. During the second five-year period after harvest, growth of residual Populus spp. had decreased from high levels observed in the first period. In contrast, growth of residual white spruce was greater in the second five-year period than in the first period. After the original harvest, re-entry of stands for additional harvest focused mainly on hardwoods may be economically rewarding and ecologically justified, depending on the overall objectives for retention. The positive effect of increased retention level on tree survival was strongest for trees with larger diameter and longer crowns. Thus, retention patches are a management option to protect large trees and trees with greater crown length when retaining such trees is a management goal.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.01.026,Article,2018

To successfully manage vulnerable forests requires the capacity of regeneration to compensate for losses from tree mortality.

Warming and drought stress killed large trees 10–15 m tall with a total number of 2881 trees during 2011–2012, and also thinned the upper crowns. David aspen recruitment increased 2 times during 2012–2015 and resulted in a high transition probability of David aspen replacing the same or other species, whereas the recruitment of Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica) was much lower: it decreased from 2012 to 2015, indicating that rapid regeneration represented a regrowth phase for David aspen, and not succession to Mongolian oak. Further, we found that the recruitment density increased with canopy openness, thus implying that warming-induced mortality enhanced regeneration. Our results suggest that David aspen has a high regrowth ability to offset individual losses from warming-induced mortality.

Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is the most widespread tree species in North America, but fire exclusion often promotes the succession to conifer dominated forests. Aspen in the Western US have been found to store more SOC in the mineral soil than nearby conifers, but we do not yet fully understand the source of this differential SOC accumulation. We measured total SOC storage (0–50 cm), characterized stable and labile SOC pools, and quantified above- and belowground litter inputs and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes during snowmelt in plots located in N and S Utah, to elucidate the role of foliage vs. root detritus in SOC storage and stabilization in both ecosystems. While leaf litterfall was twice as high under aspen as under conifers, input of litter-derived DOC with snowmelt water was consistently higher under conifers. Fine root (mm) biomass, estimated root detritus input, and root-derived DOC fluxes were also higher under conifers. A strong positive relationship between root and light fraction C content suggests that root detritus mostly fueled the labile fraction of SOC. Overall, neither differences in above- and belowground detritus C inputs nor in detritus-derived DOC fluxes could explain the higher and more stable SOC pools under aspen. We hypothesize that root–microbe–soil interactions in the rhizosphere are more likely to drive these SOC pool differences.",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f8040118,Article,2017

We used sap flow sensors on the root system of aspen located in the Fraser Experimental Forest (Colorado) to quantify water fluxes, assess directionality of flow and assess responses to a root severing experiment. Our results indicate simultaneous, bi-directional flow in roots with 3–4 times more flow in one direction. Flow towards ramets that were subjected to severing of roots (except the measured root) decreased considerably, and an increase in root flow ‘down the line’ towards connected, untreated ramets suggests complex interactions within the root system.

However, the quantity and quality of these structural attributes in old forest stands are likely to be influenced by important latitudinal changes in tree species composition and productivity from the southern boreal mixed to the northern coniferous forests. We measured habitat occupancy of cavity and bark nesting birds in old forests when the boreal forest landscape shifts from a mixed to a dominant coniferous matrix in the Clay Belt of Québec and Ontario, a region where paludification dominates. Using playback calls, songs, and recent woodpeckers’ foraging signs on trees, we measured the occurrence and foraging habitat use of 11 bird species associated with deadwood in 86 unmanaged forest stands along a forest age gradient in both mixed and coniferous stands. In coniferous stands dominated by black spruce, deadwood birds showed a modal distribution in response to the aging of black spruce forests that reached a peak in stands of 160 years and then declined. Unproductive paludified stands, which made up more than 40% of our study area, were associated with a significantly lower species richness of deadwood birds. At the opposite, although they represented less than 4% of the forest cover in our study area, old boreal mixedwood forests (>90 years) were highly utilized habitats by deadwood birds. Structural diversity of trees (diversity of degradation stages and diameter of trees) was the variable that best explained species richness of this functional group of birds whereas at the individual species level, the quantity and quality of dead trees (degradation and size) in stands best explained species occurrence and abundance of foraging signs. Conservation efforts for deadwood birds should focus on old productive stands of both mixed and coniferous composition.

Antecedent effects of herbivores can be identified through remnants of dead stems and altered tree morphology as well as changes in tree ring patterns and growth. Increases in fire severity, particularly surface fuel combustion, in the boreal forest of western North America can cause a shift in the successional trajectory from coniferous to deciduous dominated forests, which may alter plant–animal interactions. We measured height and tree ring growth of the two dominant canopy tree species, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP), in sites that experienced stand-replacing fire with deep versus shallow surface fuel combustion 20 years ago. We also classified individual trees into a category of browsing damage based on external features and morphology. We hypothesized the effects of browsing to be contingent on fire severity. Using linear mixed effect models, we investigated the main and interactive effects of fire severity and browsing intensity on aspen growth. We also developed tree ring chronologies to test for growth releases in aspen and black spruce. Effects of moose browsing on aspen growth depended on fire severity (surface fuel combustion), with negative effects in high severity sites and no effects in low severity sites. Spruce growth showed no direct or indirect browsing effects, indicating moose have not altered the potential for spruce to reach the forest canopy. Aspen in severely burned sites showed abrupt growth releases in tree rings corresponding to changes in herbivore pressure and density. Height-growth projections indicated that moose slowed the rate of aspen growth and canopy dominance in severely burned areas by ten years, through repeated stunting of apical growth in aspen, without affecting the initial trajectory to an aspen-dominated canopy. Lightly burned areas, with their larger proportion of spruce biomass, slower aspen growth, and reduced browsing pressure during the first 20 years after fire, will likely provide accessible aspen forage until >50 years post-fire as sites return to spruce dominance. Heterogeneously burned forests could thus sustain high rates of available moose forage for a much longer period than previously reported.

Although trees and their cavities change as they age, with trees becoming softer and cavities becoming larger, it is not known how their value as nesting resources varies with age. In the context of wildlife and forest management, we investigated the relative value of generating a supply of fresh cavities, which are thought to be of high quality, versus protecting cavities as they age and expand in interior volume. For 21 years (1995–2016), we monitored the formation and occupancy of tree cavities used by >30 species of birds and mammals in interior British Columbia, Canada. Cavity occupancy by secondary users was highest 1 year post‐excavation (53%), then declined to 40% after 2 years, remained at 33 ± 7% (SD) between 3 and 16 years of age, and increased to 50% use from 17–20 years post‐excavation. Excavators that reused cavities (woodpeckers [Picidae], nuthatches [Sitta spp.]) strongly selected 1‐ and 2‐year‐old cavities, large‐bodied non‐excavators (ducks, raptors, squirrels) selected mid‐aged cavities, and mountain bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) selected most strongly for the oldest cavities. Cavities created in living aspen trees (Populus spp.), especially those excavated by northern flickers (Colaptes auratus), maintained high occupancy by secondary users across cavity age, and provided the bulk of cavities used in this system. Altogether, these results show that a diverse excavator community is needed to generate a supply of fresh cavities in the ecosystem, and retention of the mid‐aged and older cavities will help support larger species. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.21398,Article,2017

7610,Burke Thomas Greer,Differences in Evolutionary History and Ploidy Type Shape the Interactions of Populus tremuloides Michx. with Climate,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,"Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx) is a species with high phenotypic plasticity and a broad distribution that, in the last decade, has experienced climate stress-induced mortality called Sudden Aspen Decline (SAD). In order to help mitigate the effects of SAD in the future, we need a better understanding of aspen’s climate adaptation. We also need to learn more about how aspen structure and function relate to climate. To that end, this dissertation seeks to improve our understanding of aspen biogeography by exploring multi-scale genetic-climate interactions. First, we examined aspen climate adaptation, asking if genetic relatedness corresponded to any similarities or differences in climate niche across aspen’s range. We found that two aspen sub-populations, with genetic differences, had distinctly different climate niches and we concluded that aspen species distribution models should include genetic relatedness to predict species range more accurately. We also studied how polyploidy in aspen affected the structure and function of leaves, branches, and ramets. We found that diploid and triploid aspen had differences in leaf traits that ultimately drove greater triploid maximum photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE). However, despite greater iWUE in triploids, we found that they were actually more prone to climate-induced stress because of higher stomatal conductance rates and less stomatal sensitivity and control than diploids. Finally, we measured growth and iWUE in tree rings from diploid and triploid aspen. We learned that diploid growth had statistically significant positive correlations with total precipitation and the last day with snow on the ground. We also found that triploid growth had a statistically significant positive correlation with total precipitation, and a negative correlation with vapor pressure deficit. In addition, we found that while iWUE in both diploids and triploids increased during years with less available water, iWUE was nearly 4% greater in triploid aspen in every year. To maintain this ~4% greater iWUE when there was less available water, it is likely that triploid aspen did not reduce photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance as much as diploids. Again, this suggests that triploids may be more prone than diploids to climate-induced stress because triploids require more water than diploids when there is less water available. Overall, our findings improve our understanding of macroscale and local scale interactions between aspen and climate.",http://hdl.handle.net/1957/60326,Thesis/Dissertation,2017

7612,Christopher Stockdale,A century of landscape change in the southern Rocky Mountains and foothills of Alberta: Using historical photography to quantify ecological change.,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,"Throughout the Rocky Mountain regions of North America fire regimes have been altered towards longer fire return intervals in the 20th century as compared to the 18th and 19th centuries; this has been accompanied by losses of grassland and open canopy woodlands due to encroachment by closed canopy forests. However, we lack information regarding how much grassland or open canopy woodland has been lost, where these losses have occurred, and what has caused them. I examined what we know about fire regimes, and how we incorporate this knowledge into management of forested landscapes. Historical land-based oblique angle photographs taken at the start of the 20th century can provide information regarding what vegetation looked like when humans began to alter fire regimes. Unlike aerial photographs, which are used extensively in remote sensing, the major challenges associated with using historical photographs are that georeferencing methods and image classification procedures are still in their infancy. No one has yet conducted a landscape scale spatial analysis of oblique angle historical photographs to describe vegetation change, and to determine the causes or correlates associated with this change. I developed new methods in GIS and image analysis by using a new software tool (the WSL Monoplotting Tool), and created a new method to extract raster-based data from oblique angle historic photos. I used 137 historical repeat photographs from the Mountain Legacy Project covering 320,000 ha in the southern Alberta Rocky Mountains to measure the vegetation change across the landscape between 1909 and 2008. I found that the majority of the landscape (63.4%) had remained in the same vegetation category, 28% of the landscape was in a later seral stage, and less than 9% was in an earlier state. In 1909 58% of the landscape was non-forest (grasslands, meadows, shrubs, non-vegetated and open canopy woodlands) and 42% in closed canopy forest (conifer, broadleaf deciduous and mixedwood). In 2008 42% was non-forested and 58% forested. The Montane Natural Subregion had the greatest proportion of area undergoing successional advancement, with substantial (but lesser) forward change in the Subalpine, Alpine and Foothills Parkland. We saw that nearly 37% of historical grasslands and 80% of open canopy woodlands converted to more advanced successional types, and this appears to be due to gradual forest advancement from the historic forest edge. The causes of these changes in vegetation structure were related to topography and disturbance history. I then tested the assumption that the historic vegetation structure at the turn of the 20th century was less susceptible to burning at high intensity and over larger areas than the current vegetation structure. I used the Burn-P3 model to compare burn probability, fire intensity and fire size for two different scenarios: a) the baseline scenario (the landscape as of 2014); and b) a historical restoration scenario (landscape restored its historical (1909) vegetation structure). I used a subset of the photographs I used for examining landscape vegetation change to determine what the historic vegetation composition was in the Bob Creek Wildland. I used indicator kriging to create a seamless coverage of historical vegetation structure. I found that the overall mean burn probability was only reduced by 1.2% in the historical restoration scenario. However, many areas of the landscape showed increased burn probability and others showed decreases in burn probability, and these were largely associated with expected changes in rates of spread associated with different vegetation changes between the two scenarios. Increased burn probability was associated with areas that had changed from forest to grassland, and areas with decreased burn probability were associated with portions of the landscape changed to broadleaf deciduous vegetation. When I only considered areas that would burn at an intensity greater than 4,000 kW/m, I found the historical restoration scenario reduced the mean burn probability of the landscape by 44%. The mean fire size was also reduced in the historical restoration scenario. Many parts of the wildland had burn probabilities that were less than 10% what they were in the baseline scenario. If managers were to use the historic state of the Wildland as a restoration target, they would see a net benefit with regard to losses due to intense wildfire.

Under a warming climate, plants may be less cold hardened and hence more susceptible to the effects of a sudden temperature drop. During the growth season of 2010–2011, growth and cold hardening of European aspen (Populus tremula L.) seedlings from native wild populations were examined under ambient and projected climate scenarios in greenhouses at the Haapastensyrjä research station in Southern Finland. Using locally obtained seedlings, we manipulated temperature and soil moisture during the normal growth period and then subjected them to an artificial freezing treatment during September–November 2010. At the end of the experiment, we determined seedling height, survival and the extent of stem damage, and analysed their variation with mixed effect models. Among the treatments tested, temperature was the main factor affecting survival, cold hardening, and frost damage to seedlings. The higher temperature (4 °C increase) of the 2100 future climate regime was associated with a 35% decrease in seedling survival (from 66 to 31%) during the growing period. Increased irrigation had a positive, but considerably weaker effect on seedling survival (improved survival by ca. 8%). Height of seedlings after the first growth season was enhanced by increased soil moisture and temperature, but these effects were negated the following spring by increased frost damage caused by warmer growth conditions. Although cold hardiness increased as the season progressed, increase of temperature by 1 and 4 °C severely diminished it, and survival after the freezing dropped from 55% (control) to 48% and 14%, while stem damage increased from 58% (control) to 90% and 96%, respectively. These results suggest that regeneration of north European aspen might become burdened in a warmer climate. Although survival was clearly affected, several seedlings grown under the future climate regimes survived freezing and overwintered with negligible damage, suggesting an adaptive capacity of the local population. The intraspecific competition that occurred as a side effect of the experimental setup also affected cold hardening, suggesting that stand structure might be managed to improve the resilience of aspen to frost damage.",Not found,Article,2017

An integrative survey that considers multiple operational criteria is a possible solution, and we aimed to test it in a species complex of aspens in China. Genetic [four chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments and 14 nuclear microsatellite loci (nSSR)] and morphological variations were collected for 76 populations and 53 populations, respectively, covering the major geographic distribution of the Populus davidiana-rotundifoliacomplex. Bayesian clustering, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), ecological niche modeling (ENM), and gene flow (migrants per generation), were employed to detect and test genetic clustering, morphological and habitat differentiation, and gene flow between/among putative species. The nSSR data and ENM suggested that there are two separately evolving meta-population lineages that correspond to P. davidiana (pd) and P. rotundifolia (pr). Furthermore, several lines of evidence supported a subdivision of P. davidiana into Northeastern (NEC) and Central-North (CNC) groups, yet they are still functioning as one species. CpDNA data revealed that five haplotype clades formed a pattern of [pdNEC, ((pdCNC, pr), (pdCNC, pr))], but most haplotypes are species-specific. Meanwhile, PCA based on morphology suggested a closer relationship between the CNC group (P. davidiana) and P. rontundifolia. Discrepancy of nSSR and ENM vs. cpDNA and morphology could have reflected a complex lineage divergence and convergence history. P. davidiana and P. rotundifolia can be regarded as a recently diverged species pair that experienced parapatric speciation due to ecological differentiation in the face of gene flow. Our findings highlight the importance of integrative surveys at population level, as we have undertaken, is an important approach to detect the boundary of a group of species that have experienced complex evolutionary history.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8795&context=aspen_bib,Article,2017

Given the frequency of these events are expected to increase in the future, understanding patterns of mortality and plant response to severe drought is important to resource managers. Drought can affect the functional, physiological, structural, and demographic properties of forest ecosystems. Remote sensing studies have documented changes in forest properties due to direct and indirect effects of drought; however, few studies have addressed this at local scales needed to characterize highly heterogeneous ecosystems in the forestshrubland ecotone. We analyzed a 22-year Landsat time series (1985–2012) to determine changes in forest in an area that experienced a relatively dry decade punctuated by two years of extreme drought. We assessed the relationship between several vegetation indices and field measured characteristics (e.g. plant area index and canopy gap fraction) and applied these indices to trend analysis to uncover the location, direction and timing of change. Finally, we assessed the interaction of climate and topography by forest functional type. The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), a measure of canopy water content, had the strongest correlation with short-term field measures of plant area index (R2 = 0.64) and canopy gap fraction (R2 = 0.65). Over the entire time period, 25% of the forested area experienced a significant (p-value < 0.05) negative trend in NDMI, compared to less than 10% in a positive trend. Coniferous forests were more likely to be associated with a negative NDMI trend than deciduous forest. Forests on southern aspects were least likely to exhibit a negative trend while north aspects were most prevalent. Field plots with a negative trend had a lower live density, and higher amounts of standing dead and down trees compared to plots with no trend. Our analysis identifies spatially explicit patterns of long-term trends anchored with ground based evidence to highlight areas of forest that are resistant, persistent or vulnerable to severe drought. The results provide a long-term perspective for the resource management of this area and can be applied to similar ecosystems throughout western North America. Published by Elsevier B.V.

7585,Franziska Bandau,Importance of tannins for responses of aspen to anthropogenic nitrogen enrichment.,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,"Boreal forests are often strongly nitrogen (N) limited. However, human activities are leading to increased N inputs into these ecosystems, through atmospheric N deposition and forest fertilization. N input into boreal forests can promote net primary productivity, increase herbivore and pathogen damage, and shift plant species composition and community structure. Genetic diversity has been suggested as a key mechanism to promote a plant species stability within communities in response to environmental change. Within any plant population, specific traits (e.g. growth and defense traits) can vary substantially among individuals, and a greater variation in traits may increase chances for the persistence of at least some individuals of a population, when environmental conditions change. One aspect of plant chemistry that can greatly vary among different genotypes (GTs) are condensed tannin (CTs). These secondary metabolites have been suggested to affect plant performance in many ways, e.g. through influencing plant growth, the interactions of plants with herbivores and pathogens, and through affecting litter decomposition, and hence the return of nutrients to plants. To investigate how genotypic variation in foliar CT production may mediate the effects that anthropogenic N enrichment can have on plant performance and litter decomposition, I performed a series of experiments. For these experiments, aspen (Populus tremula) GTs with contrasting abilities to produce foliar CTs (i.e. low- vs. high-tannin producers) were grown under 3 N conditions, representing ambient N (+0 kg ha-1), upper level atmospheric N deposition (+15 kg ha-1), and forest fertilization rates (+150 kg ha-1). This general experimental set-up was once established in a field-like environment, from which natural enemies were excluded, and once in a field, in which enemies were present. In my first two studies, I investigated tissue chemistry and plant performance in both environments. I observed that foliar CT levels decreased in response to N in the enemy-free environment (study I), but increased with added N when enemies were present (study II). These opposing responses to N may be explained by differences in soil N availability in the two environments, or by induction of CTs after enemy attack. Enemy damage generally increased in response to N, and was higher in low-tannin than in high-tannin plants across all N levels. Plant growth of high-tannin plants was restricted under ambient and low N conditions, probably due to a trade-off between growth and defense. This growth constraint for high-tannin plants was weakened, when high amounts of N were added (study I and II), and when enemy levels were sufficiently high, so that benefits gained through defense could outweigh the costs of defense production (study II). Despite those general responses of low- and high-tannin producers to added N, I also observed a number of individual responses of GTs to N addition, which in some case were not connected to the intrinsic ability of the GTs to produce foliar CTs. In study III, gene expression levels in young leaves and phenolic pools of the plants that were grown in the enemy-free environment were studied. This study revealed that gene control over the regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway (PPP) was distributed across the entire pathway. Moreover, PPP gene expression was higher in high-tannin GTs than in low-tannin GTs, particularly under ambient N. At the low N level, gene expressions declined for both low- and high-tannin producers, whereas at the high N level expression at the beginning and the end of the PPP was upregulated and difference between tannin groups disappeared. Furthermore, this study showed that phenolic pools were frequently uncorrelated, and that phenolic pools were only to some extent related to tannin production and gene expression. In study IV, I investigated the decomposability of litter from the field plants. I found that N enrichment generally decreased mass loss, but there was substantial genetic variation in decomposition rates, and GTs were differentially responsive to added N. Study IV further showed that CTs only had a weak effect on decomposition, and other traits, such as specific leaf area and the lignin:N ratio, could better explain genotypic difference in mass loss. Furthermore, N addition caused a shift in which traits most strongly influenced decomposition rates. Collectively, the result of these studies highlight the importance of genetic diversity to promote the stability of species in environments that experience anthropogenic change.",https://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:927526/FULLTEXT01.pdf,Thesis/Dissertation,2016

Fr., 1829) in a foundation tree species, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). We established a common garden of potted aspen saplings, incorporating five tree genotypes, two levels of soil nutrients (low and high), and two levels of competition (with and without grass). We then surveyed natural incidence of powdery mildew and aspen vigor (i.e., growth). Incidence of powdery mildew varied among aspen genotypes, and variance in incidence shifted among environments in which the trees were grown. Added soil nutrients increased powdery mildew incidence on aspen, whereas grass competition had the opposite effect. Interestingly, grass competition either enhanced or dampened the variance in incidence of powdery mildew among tree genotypes, depending on soil nutrient levels. In addition, powdery mildew incidence was positively related to tree vigor. Our findings reveal strong genetic, environmental, and genetic×environmental effects of disease on a foundation tree species and that particular environments can either enhance or diminish variation in responses among tree genotypes.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/cjfr-2016-0116,Article,2016

Removal of conifers is being tested, however, little is known about treatment longevity—the time taken for stand density to return to pretreatment levels. To determine longevity of treatments removing conifers below different size limits, we developed tree growth equations from data collected in 1 ha plots around Lake Tahoe in P. tremuloides stands with varying amounts of conifer, and simulated stand development after treatment in two stands. At Ward Creek, cutting all conifer < 35 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) generated the most wood that could practically be piled and burned inside the stand, but only reduced stand density by 16%. After 13 years of predicted treatment longevity, a second treatment was simulated with options of light, medium, or heavy cutting (50, 60, or 75 cm DBH limits). This gave treatment longevity of 23, 29, and 40 years respectively but did not restore P. tremuloides dominance. At Cookhouse Meadow, cutting conifer < 35 cm DBH had 16-year treatment longevity, after which time two treatments were compared. Cutting conifers < 50 cm DBH enhanced P. tremuloides’ representation from 27% to 37% of stand basal area and had 23-year treatment longevity. Raising the DBH limit to 60 cm left P. tremuloides representing 45% of stand basal area, and extended treatment longevity to 36 years. Our findings indicate that a series of treatments will be needed to restore and maintain P. tremuloides communities, and will eventually require removal of large conifers (> 75 cm DBH).",http://er.uwpress.org/content/34/3/236.full.pdf,Article,2016

Aspen recruitment was low (<3 aspen·ha−1·year−1) in the mid-1900s prior to exclosure construction due to herbivory by Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758) but increased more than 60-fold within 25 years after exclosure construction despite a drying climatic trend since 1940. Results support the hypothesis that long-term aspen decline in Yellowstone's northern range during the latter half of the 20th century was caused by high levels of ungulate herbivory and not a drying climate. Gray wolves (Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758) were reintroduced during 1995–1996. For the period 1995–2012, we summarized annual predator–prey ratios, ungulate biomass, and drought severity. The average density of young aspen increased from 4350 aspen·ha−1 in 1997–1998 to 8960 aspen·ha−1 in 2012; during the same time period, those >1 m in height increased over 30-fold (from 105 to 3194 aspen·ha−1).

Since wolf reintroduction, 24 assessments of deciduous woody plants in riparian areas have been published, including eleven on willow (Salix spp.), six on aspen (Populus tremuloides), five on cottonwood (Populus angustifolia and Populus trichocarpa), and one each on berry-producing shrubs and thinleaf alder (Alnus incana spp. tenuifolia). All but two of these studies found increases in plant height, stem diameter, stem establishment, canopy cover, or recruitment. More than half of the studies measured ungulate browsing and, in all instances, increased growth/cover of woody plants over time occurred concurrently with a decrease in browsing. Almost half of the studies also compared observed plant community changes to climatic/hydrologic variables but the results of these analyses were often inconsistent. Although the long-term warming and drying trends underway in northern Yellowstone appear unlikely to have contributed to the occurrence of improved riparian plant communities during the last two decades, these vegetation changes were consistent with reestablishment of a tri-trophic cascade involving an intact large predator guild, elk, and woody plant species. This early stage of vegetation recovery in northern Yellowstone, although not occurring everywhere, represents a major departure from the wide-spread suppression of woody plants by elk browsing that occurred in the decades when wolves were absent.",http://www.cof.orst.edu/leopold/papers/Beschta_Ripple2016.pdf,Article,2016

Ericaceous dwarf shrubs and 3– to 4-year vole–mustelid cycles characterize the European boreal forests, whereas tall deciduous shrubs and 10-year snowshoe hare–lynx cycles characterize the North American ones. We discuss plausible explanations for this difference and conclude that it is bottom-up: Winter climate is the key determinant of the dominant understory vegetation that then determines the herbivore–predator food-web interactions.

To assess how deer have broadly affected patterns of tree recruitment across northern Wisconsin, we analyzed recruitment success in 11 common trees species that vary in palatability across 13,105 USFS - FIA plots sampled between 1983 and 2013. We also examined how recruitment in these species covaried with estimated deer densities here. Saplings of five palatable species were scarce relative to less palatable species and showed highly skewed distributions. Scarcity and skew provide reliable signals of deer impacts even when deer have severely reduced recruitment and/or no reliable deer density data are available. Deer densities ranged from 2.3 to 23 deer per km2 over a 30 year period. Sapling numbers in two maples (Acer) and aspen (Populus) with intermediate palatability declined sharply in apparent response to higher deer density. Path analysis also reveals that deer act to cumulatively depress sapling recruitment in these species over successive decades. Together, these approaches show that deer have strongly depressed sapling recruitment in all taxa except Abies and Picea. As these impacts are now propagating into larger sized trees, deer are also altering canopy composition and dynamics. The tools developed here provide efficient and reliable indicators for monitoring deer impacts on forest tree recruitment using consistent data collected by public agencies.",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Waller2/publication/303405781_Impacts_of_white-tailed_deer_on_regional_patterns_of_forest_tree_recruitment/links/5774087908ae4645d60a0bee/Impacts-of-white-tailed-deer-on-regional-patterns-of-forest-tree-recruitment.pdf,Article,2016

Changing climate, altered disturbance regimes, land use, and increased herbivore pressure threaten these forests both in Eurasia and North America. In addition, rapid mortality dubbed “Sudden Aspen Decline” is a concern for aspen's long‐term presence in the western United States, especially Colorado and Utah. Yet it is still unclear whether aspen is persistent or declining at the landscape scale. We assessed aspen persistence at different spatial scales in the Colorado Front Range by resampling 89 plots containing aspen from among 305 vegetation plots sampled by Robert Peet during 1972–1973. We hypothesized that aspen density and basal area had decreased at the landscape scale, with notable variability in change depending on the forest community type, and that this overall decrease has been more pronounced at lower elevations. We also assessed elevational range shifts of the major species in these forests. Aspen were no longer present in 22 of the 89 plots and aspen density for stems less than 2.5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) had declined significantly overall, although density of medium (2.5–10 cm DBH) and large (>10 cm DBH) trees, as well as basal area, had not changed significantly. A comparison between montane (<2700 m elevation) and subalpine (2700–3500 m elevation) plots revealed that the decrease was more pronounced at higher elevations and was mostly the result of substantial decreases of stems in the eleven plots that were part of Peet's aspen‐dominated “Populus tremuloides series.” In these plots, aspen basal area decreased significantly whereas basal area of Abies bifolia, Picea engelmannii, Pinus contorta, and Pseudotsuga menziesii increased substantially. Upslope shifts were observed for most species, especially on northeast facing slopes, suggesting climate‐related responses. In summary, aspen have been resilient in mixed forests and may be beneficiaries of recent bark beetle epidemics, but have decreased and been subject to successional transitions in previously aspen‐dominated stands.

Using a retrospective approach, we quantified the response of regenerating aspen stems to an ordinary set of silvicultural treatments conducted over approximately the past decade in southern Utah, USA. A suite of variables describing stand structure and composition, stand vigor, physiographic factors, herbivore pressure, and treatment types were measured to predict the possible controls, as well as their relative importance, on aspen regeneration. Results suggested that aspen regeneration was most strongly related to browsing pressure, site preparation technique, and the presence of advance reproduction before treatment, which is a novel finding. Secondary predictors included elevation, site index, and overstory conditions, which are generally characteristics of stand vigor. Management recommendations based on our results should recognize the strong primary control that browsing pressure exerts on regeneration. First, the height of advance reproduction is inherently dependent on antecedent herbivory and also indicative of present browsing and should be assessed before treatment. Second, the most effective site preparation techniques, namely broadcast burning and browsing reduction, will directly reduce browsing pressure, assuming ungulate populations are not too large. Any management targeting timely and effective aspen regeneration should incorporate monitoring and (or) controlling browsing pressure, both before and after treatment.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/cjfr-2016-0010,Article,2016

In quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), phenolic glycosides (PGs) and condensed tannins (CTs) constitute up to 30 % of leaf dry weight. To quantify the allocation cost of this chemical defense, we measured growth, defense chemistry, and individual heterozygosity (Hobs at 16 microsatellite loci) for male and female trees in both controlled and natural environments. The controlled environment consisted of 12 juvenile genets grown for 3 years in a common garden, with replication. The natural environment consisted of 51 mature genets in wild populations, from which we sampled multiple ramets (trees) per genet. Concentrations of PGs and CTs were negatively correlated. PGs were uncorrelated with growth, but CT production represented a major cost. Across the range of CT levels found in wild-grown trees, growth rates varied by 2.6-fold, such that a 10 % increase in CT concentration occurred with a 38.5 % decrease in growth. Hobs had a marked effect on aspen growth: for wild trees, a 10 % increase in Hobs corresponded to a 12.5 % increase in growth. In wild trees, this CT effect was significant only in females, in which reproduction seems to exacerbate the cost of defense, while the Hobs effect was significant only in males. Despite the lower growth rate of low-Hobs trees, their higher CT levels may improve survival, which could account for the deficit of heterozygotes repeatedly found in natural aspen populations.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00442-016-3577-6.pdf,Article,2016

Plants produce a diversity of defense compounds that affect the ability of herbivores to utilize these strategies in response to variation in food nutritional quality. Little is known, however, about effects of allelochemicals on herbivores utilizing integrated behavioral and morphological responses to reduced food quality. Our objectives were to (1) examine how variation in diet nutritional quality influences compensatory responses of a generalist insect herbivore, and (2) determine how plant defenses affect these processes. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larvae were administered one of nine combinations of diet having low, moderate, or high nutritional quality and 0, 2, or 4 % purified aspen (Populus tremuloides) salicinoids. We quantified larval growth, consumption, frass production, and biomass allocation to midgut tissue over a 4-day bioassay. In the absence of salicinoids, larvae compensated for reduced nutritional quality and maintained similar growth across all diets through increased consumption, altered midgut biomass allocation, and improved processing efficiencies. Dietary salicinoids reduced larval consumption, midgut biomass allocation, digestive efficiencies, and growth at all nutritional levels, but the effect size was more pronounced when larvae were fed nutritionally suboptimal diets. Our findings demonstrate that integrated behavioral and morphological compensatory responses to reduced food quality are affected by plant defenses, ultimately limiting compensatory responses and reducing larval performance.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11829-016-9439-7.pdf,Article,2016

Thus, we examined correlations between soil N levels and both expression patterns of eight PPP genes (measured by quantitative-reverse transcription PCR) and foliar phenolic compounds (measured by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) in young aspen genets with intrinsically extreme CT levels. Monitored phenolics included salicinoids, lignins, flavones, flavonols, CT precursors and CTs. The PPP genes were consistently expressed more strongly in high-CT trees. Low N supplements reduced expression of genes throughout the PPP in all genets, while high N doses restored expression of genes at the beginning and end of the pathway. These PPP changes were not reflected in pools of tannin precursors, but varying correlations between gene expression and foliar phenolic pools were detected in young and mature leaves, suggesting that processes linking gene expression and the resulting phenolics vary spatially and temporally. Precursor fluxes suggested that CT-related metabolic rate or sink controls are linked to intrinsic carbon allocation strategies associated with N responses. Overall, we found more negative correlations (indicative of allocation trade-offs) between PPP gene expression and phenolic products following N additions in low-CT plants than in high-CT plants. The tannin-related expression dynamics suggest that, in addition to defense, relative tannin levels may also be indicative of intraspecific variations in the way aspen genets respond to soil fertility.",https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/treephys/tpw118,Article,2016

The influence of forest harvesting on the interaction between threatened boreal caribou, moose, and wolves constitutes a classic example. When conifer forests are logged, clear-cuts are colonized by deciduous vegetation that provides high-quality food for moose. Subsequent changes in wolf distribution alter predation risk for caribou. Given that primary productivity varies along latitudinal gradients, the effects of logging on moose-caribou-wolf interactions could also vary moving northwards. Empirical evidence, however, is lacking and current recommendations for caribou conservation are fixed over space. We assessed whether the impact of logging activities on caribou-moose-wolf interactions varies with latitude. We estimated deciduous vegetation availability from satellite imagery, and followed all three species with GPS collars to evaluate their habitat selection. We found that the availability of deciduous vegetation in logged stands decreased along a 400-km latitudinal gradient. The probability of caribou occurrence remained low in clear-cuts, regardless of deciduous vegetation availability. Moose and wolves increased their selection for clear-cuts as they contained more deciduous vegetation. Accordingly, the relative co-occurrence probability of moose and wolves was strongly associated with clear-cuts at low latitudes, but weakly so at high latitudes. Clear-cuts should therefore attract moose and wolves more strongly to prime boreal caribou habitat at lower latitudes, and caribou predation risk should follow similar geographical patterns. Conservation planning should account for geographical patterns in the risk faced by threatened populations because the effectiveness of strategies developed from average patterns can decrease over space, in consistent manner.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716300982/pdfft?md5=8d9dc674752c0f0f84fde93dfd1a37f0&pid=1-s2.0-S0006320716300982-main.pdf,Article,2016

We used replicated 7- to 209-year chronosequences to examine the influence of stand age and overstory composition on [C], [N], and [P] and their ratios in the forest floor, surface (0–15 cm), and subsurface (15–30 cm) mineral soil in the boreal forest of central Canada. In the forest floor, [C] and [N] increased rapidly during the first three decades following fire, after which they fluctuated, but remained larger than in the youngest stands.

However, various factors may influence the physical decay and disappearance of pellets, where disappearance may be a result of physical decay and other factors (e.g. trampling, scattering and concealment by vegetation). Knowing pellet decay and disappearance rates in different habitats is a prerequisite to acquiring reliable information from pellet counts. We examined elk Cervus canadensis pellet decay and disappearance of individual pellets and pellet groups in six habitats in the boreal forest of northwestern Canada. We monitored 120 pellet groups deposited in May 2008 at 4, 12, 16 and 28 month intervals (i.e. the end of each of three plant growing seasons) to assess differences in physical decay and disappearance. Pellet decay and disappearance varied among habitats. In moist habitats, pellets showed little sign of decay by the end of our study, likely due to a short plant growing season. In drier, open habitat types, pellet decay was more rapid, likely due to exposure to sun and wind. By the end of our study, the percent of pellets remaining varied from a 14–82% among the sampled habitats. Pellets in moist forest habitats had the lowest decay rates but the highest disappearance rates, whereas those in dry, grassland sites had the highest decay, but the lowest disappearance rates. Our study further demonstrates that ungulate pellet decay and disappearance may differ substantially among habitats, which has important implications for the design of ungulate monitoring programs that utilize pellet counts. We conclude by recommending that fecal accumulation rate (FAR) methods are likely more appropriate in our study area than fecal standing crop (FSC) methods for estimating elk density, because FAR methods are less prone to biases associated with differential pellet decay and disappearance among habitats.",http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.2981/wlb.00186,Article,2016

The presence of an aspen overstory serves to ameliorate frost and winter injury problems and suppresses understory vegetation that may compete with white spruce. Under future climatic regimes with more frequent and severe drought episodes, underplanting may be a costeffective strategy for lowering the risk of mortality in mixedwood regeneration. We examine the growth of white spruce during the first 18 years after being planted beneath a 39-year-old stand of trembling aspen. Treatments included thinning from over 6000 stems·ha−1 to 3000, 2000, and 1000 stems·ha−1 and fertilization. Initial stimulation of understory vegetation by fertilization had no measureable effect on spruce heights or diameters at year 18. Aspen thinning treatments did not have a significant effect on spruce height growth rates after spruce crowns had emerged above the understory shrub layer due to rapid aspen basal area increases after thinning. Small, but significant, increases for spruce height and diameter were present in the 1000 and 2000 stem·ha−1 aspen thinnings. A much wider range of aspen stand conditions may be suitable for planting spruce to create mixedwood ecosystems than has been previously considered.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/cjfr-2015-0440,Article,2016

Variation in tree species dominance within these regions is generally caused by a combination of historical and prevailing disturbance regimes, including both chronic and episodic disturbances, their magnitude and frequency, as well as differences in edaphic conditions and topography. Because of their remoteness, slow growth and restrictions of use, these mountain forests are generally less affected by human utilization than more productive and easily utilizable forests at lower elevations and/or latitudes. As a consequence, these northern forests of Europe are often referred to as “Europe’s last wilderness”, even if human influence of varying intensity has been ubiquitous through historical time. Because of their naturalness, the North Fennoscandian mountain forests are of paramount importance for biodiversity conservation, monitoring of ecosystem change and for their sociocultural values.

These effects could result in lowered forest productivity and threaten the long-term sustainability of forest management. Retaining organic material post-harvest, including greater amounts of harvesting slash and live trees, within harvested areas may ameliorate some negative effects of biomass harvesting on soil processes. We evaluated the effects of biomass harvests with reserve tree and slash retention on the SMC and soil nutrient bioavailability (assessed using plant-root simulator probes) in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forests in northern Minnesota during the spring and summer, 1–3 years after harvest. Variable biomass removal levels tested include complete removal (whole tree harvest of boles and branches), complete slash retention (bole only harvest), and 20% slash retention (amount suggested by regional biomass harvesting guidelines). Compared to the unharvested control, biomass harvests had no effect on the multivariate SMC composition or microbial biomass, but did result in a 1–4% increase in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance and reduced bacterial stress two and three years after harvest. Additionally, biomass harvesting increased NH4 bioavailability during year one, and reduced NO3 bioavailability during year two when compared to unharvested controls. Among the three biomass harvests with differing levels of slash removal there were few differences in overall SMC composition, microbial biomass, and soil nutrients; however, the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, gram positive and actinomycete bacteria were significantly higher in harvested treatments with more slash retained. These results are specific to single rotation biomass harvesting in aspen stands due to the unique relationships between plants and their associated SMCs, and may not be directly applicable to forest biomass harvesting of other commercial forest tree species, or multiple rotations.",https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2016/nrs_2016_lewandowski_001.pdf,Article,2016

Trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides, contains two principal groups of defenses, phenolic glycosides (salicinoids) and condensed tannins, which differentially affect the folivorous gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, and its gut symbionts. The bacteria genus Acinetobacter is frequently associated with both aspen foliage and gypsy moth consuming that tissue, and one isolate, Acinetobacter sp. R7-1, previously has been shown to metabolize phenolic glycosides. In this study, we aimed to characterize further interactions between this Acinetobacter isolate and aspen secondary metabolites. We assessed bacterial carbon utilization and growth in response to different concentrations of phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins. We also tested if enzyme inhibitors reduce bacterial growth and catabolism of phenolic glycosides. Acinetobacter sp.R7-1 utilized condensed tannins but not phenolic glycosides or glucose as carbon sources. Growth in nutrient-rich medium was increased by condensed tannins, but reduced by phenolic glycosides. Addition of the P450 enzyme inhibitor piperonyl butoxide increased the effects of phenolic glycosides on Acinetobacter sp. R7-1. In contrast, the esterase inhibitor S, S,S,-tributyl-phosphorotrithioate did not affect phenolic glycoside inhibition of bacterial growth. Degradation of phenolic glycosides by Acinetobacter sp. R7-1 appears to alleviate the cytotoxicity of these compounds, rather than provide an energy source. Our results further suggest this bacterium utilizes additional, complementary mechanisms to degrade antimicrobial phytochemicals. Collectively, these results provide insight into mechanisms by which microorganisms contend with their environment within the context of plant-herbivore interactions.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10886-016-0677-z.pdf,Article,2016

Although wholesale blocking of EF nectar has been shown to reduce ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) visitation to aspen, the effect of more subtle and realistic variations in nectar availability on ant recruitment is unknown. Working in Alaskan boreal forest (United States of America), we reduced and supplemented EF nectar availability on potted aspen ramets of three genotypes and surveyed visitation by free-living Formica fusca (Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Ants were more responsive to a subtle increase in sugar availability than to a decrease. While nectar reduction had no effect on ant visitation, nectar supplementation increased ant visitation to one aspen genotype by 70% during an early summer trial. Average ant visitation to different aspen genotypes varied during the late summer, indicating that aspen genotype can influence attractiveness to ants. We conclude that natural induction of EF secretion in response to herbivory may benefit aspen through improved ant recruitment, though the response is dependent on aspen genotype and time of year. Differences among aspen genets in attractiveness to ants could influence the relative success of genotypes, especially in settings in which aspen regenerates from seed.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/17ADDD0C22D8C6FFCB6E0E630165AF71/S0008347X15000383a_hi.pdf,Article,2016

Stands were classi- fied into three diameter structure types (inverted J, intermediate and advanced). There was no major difference in the distribution pattern of structural types of aspen-dominated stands between the western and eastern Canadian boreal mixedwood forests, despite a marked contrast in climatic conditions and fire regime. These results suggest that the predominance of juvenile structures in the western aspen forests is mainly related to the frequent recurrence of fires, while within eastern aspen forests, the longer fire cycle was not the controlling factor of stand structure. Anthropogenic activities would have strongly shaped the structure of aspen forests in eastern Canada. White spruce in the west and balsam fir in the east are among the main shade-tolerant conifer companion species associated with these stands.

The objective of this study was to examine how stand composition, tree proximity relationships and tree size influence the leaf functional traits of aspen, an early successional species, and subalpine fir, a climax species. We measured foliar nutrients, nonstructural carbohydrates (aspen only), defense chemistry and xylem water potential of aspen and subalpine fir trees in three size classes growing in close proximity or independently from other trees under three stand conditions: aspen dominant, aspen-conifer mixed, and conifer dominant stands. Close proximity of subalpine fir to aspen reduced aspen’s storage of starch in foliar tissue by 17% suggesting that competition between these species may have small effects on carbon metabolism in aspen leaves. Simple sugar (glucose + sucrose) concentrations in aspen leaves were slightly higher in larger aspen trees than smaller trees. However, no differences were found in stem water potential, foliar concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, or secondary defense chemicals of aspen or subalpine fir across the gradients of stand composition, tree proximity or tree size. These results suggest that mechanisms of coexistence allow both aspen and subalpine fir to maintain leaf function across a wide range of stand structural characteristics.

Wecompared these factors at primary active dams and at control sites located in stream reaches that were physically suitable fordam-building beavers but where none occurred. Beaver dams mostly occurred at sites that were not grazed or where therewas some alternative grazing management, but were mostly absent at sites within Forest Service cattle allotments. Resultsindicated that cattle grazing inuenced the relation between vegetation variables and beaver presence.

Currently, two wild populations are present in Scotland on a trial basis, and the case for their full reintroduction is currently being considered by Scottish ministers. Beavers are widely considered ‘ecosystem engineers’. Indeed, beavers have large impacts on the environment, fundamentally change ecosystems, and create unusual habi-tats, often considered unique. In this review, we investigate the mechanisms by which beavers act as ecosystem engineers, and then discuss the possible impacts of beavers on the biodiversity of Scotland. A meta-analysis of published studies on beavers’ interactions with biodiversity was conducted, and the balance of positive and negative interactions with plants, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals recorded. The meta-analysis showed that, overall, beavers have an overwhelmingly posi-tive inﬂuence on biodiversity. Beavers’ ability to modify the environment means that they fundamentally increase habitat heterogeneity. As beavers are central-place foragers that feed only in close proximity to watercourses, their herbivory is unevenly spread in the landscape. In addition, beaver ponds and their associated unique successional stages increase habitat heterogeneity both spatially and temporally. Beavers also inﬂuence the ecosystems through the creation of a variety of features such as dams and lodges, important habitat features such as standing dead wood (after inundation), an increase in woody debris, and a graded edge between terrestrial and aquatic habitats that is rich in structural complexity. In Scotland, a widespread positive inﬂuence on biodiversity is expected, if beavers are widely reintroduced. For instance, beaver activity should provide important habitat for the otter Lutra lutra, great crested newt Triturus cristatus and water vole Arvicola amphibious, all species of conservation importance. Beavers are most likely to have detrimental impacts on certain woodland habitats and species of conservation importance, such as the Atlantic hazelwood climax community and aspen Populus tremula woodland. A lack of woodland regeneration caused by high deer abundance could lead to habitat degradation or loss. These are also of particular importance due to the variety of associated dependent species of conservation interest, such as lichen communities in Atlantic hazelwoods.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mam.12068/epdf,Article,2016

Using a combination of remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) analysis, and ground-based techniques, we explored the environmental factors associated with the distribution and abundance of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) across regional gradients near its northern range limit in northwestern Quebec, Canada. Although not regionally abundant, aspen is the main deciduous tree species in this conifer-dominated landscape. Regionally, the ~51,200-km2 study area has very few settlements or roads, and little industrial resource extraction. Most of the region is inaccessible to humans except by foot or water travel. We utilized Landsat Thematic Mapper images from 2010 and 2011, and a robust collection of ground reference data developed from aerial photography, supported by field verification (vegetation sampling) where access permitted, to construct a thematic map of 11 land cover classes. The map highlights the spatial distribution of aspen, which represents only 0.3% of the study area. Map validation indicated an overall mapping accuracy of 74%, and the aspen predicted class was determined to be over 77% accurate. The regional-scale distribution of aspen stands ≥ 5 ha within the study area shows two patterns: (1) a shift toward greatest abundance on south-facing aspects with increasing latitude; and (2) a highly clustered pattern with a strong signal of concentration in areas of human activity. These patterns suggest that aspen range expansion due to climate warming will vary with topographic and other microclimatic factors (i.e. be a function of climate change interacting with landscapes) and that anthropogenic activities have the potential to influence future aspen abundance independently of climate. Forest management policies concerned with changing forest composition in these northern landscapes should recognize the potentially important role of human activity in driving the abundance of aspen.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811271630072X/pdfft?md5=99041b1f9022c52700da1c496b90435a&pid=1-s2.0-S037811271630072X-main.pdf,Article,2016

After re-contouring and top soil placement on the sites, we assessed the extent of surface disturbance, soil temperature, soil bulk density, and the density and height of aspen regeneration. Aspen suckers were tallest, had the highest density and had better survival when the forest floor was protected compared to the standard Rollback treatment. When protecting the forest floor, delineating the original forest floor from the subsoil cover resulted only in small differences in the aspen regeneration among delineation treatments with little impact on soil compaction and only moderate effects on soil surface disturbance.

We found a 90 % decrease in the amount of bare soil (P < 0.001) and a 63 % decrease in exposed channel (P < 0.001) as well as a significant increase in the cover of grasses/sedges/forbs (15 % increase, P = 0.037), rushes (389 % increase, P = 0.014), and willow (388 % increase, P < 0.001). We also assessed the accuracy of the new method of inserting digital line transects into photo pairs. An overall accuracy of 91 % (kappa 83 %) suggests that digital line transects can be a useful tool for quantifying vegetation cover from photos. Our results indicate that the removal of cattle can result in dramatic changes in riparian vegetation, even in semi-arid landscapes and without replanting or other active restoration efforts.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-014-0436-2,Article,2015

However, multiple factors can impair the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks; prominent among these are tropospheric O3 and nutrient limitations1,2. Herbivorous insects also influence carbon and nutrient dynamics in forest ecosystems, yet are often ignored in ecosystem models of forest productivity. Here we assess the effects of elevated levels of CO2 and O3 on insect-mediated canopy damage and organic matter deposition in aspen and birch stands at the Aspen FACE facility in northern Wisconsin, United States. Canopy damage was markedly higher in the elevated CO2 stands, as was the deposition of organic substrates and nitrogen. The opposite trends were apparent in the elevated O3 stands. Using a light-use efficiency model, we show that the negative impacts of herbivorous insects on net primary production more than doubled under elevated concentrations of CO2, but decreased under elevated concentrations of O3. We conclude that herbivorous insects may limit the capacity of forests to function as sinks for anthropogenic carbon emissions in a high CO2 world.",http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201516,Article,2015

Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) were grown under elevated levels of CO2 and/or O3at the Aspen FACE research site in northern WI, USA. We measured the effects of CO2 and O3 on nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen (C:N), and condensed tannin levels in aspen and birch leaves and senescent litter and also in the frass of folivores fed aspen or birch green leaves. Overall, the effects of elevated CO2 on foliar chemistry were less pronounced than those of elevated O3, and aspen responded more strongly than birch. While the effects of elevated CO2 and O3 on foliar chemistry were generally reflected in frass chemistry, the magnitude of the response varied among insect species. Insect frass had higher nitrogen and condensed tannin levels and lower C:N ratios than did litter, although the magnitude of this response varied among fumigation treatments and insect species. Our findings demonstrate that the quality of insect-mediated organic deposition can be indirectly affected by atmospheric change, through altered foliar quality. Our findings also suggest that the quality of frass deposited on the forest floor via herbivory will be strongly affected by herbivore community composition.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11829-013-9286-8,Article,2015

In this study, we investigated cytotype differences between diploid and triploid aspen clones using dendrochronological techniques. We used tree-ring data collected from stems within an aspen stand near Fish Lake, Utah, to test for differences in stem age, population structure, growth, and response to climate. This stand contains the well-known Pando clone, which is purported to be the largest organism documented on earth. Our results show that triploid aspen stems grew more rapidly than diploids, and that this difference was most pronounced early in stand development. Growth response to climate varied little between triploids and diploids, where wide rings were associated with cool, moist years, and narrow rings were associated with above-average growing season temperatures. Stand development processes and inherent genetic differences are mechanisms possibly controlling the observed differences in aspen ring width between triploids and diploids. Regardless of the mechanism, the results have specific management implications. Conventional regeneration methods involving coppicing and the associated intermediate treatments will promote asexually reproducing triploids, leading to static or reduced genetic diversity. Enhanced genetic diversity will be favored by management actions that explicitly account for (i) the potential existence of multiple cytotypes within a stand and (ii) the observed differences in growth rates between diploid and triploid individuals.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjfr-2014-0382#.VV5FgVnBzRY,Article,2015

More has been learned about the role of broadleaves in forest ecosystems however ecosystem-specific knowledge about the competitive interactions between mixed broadleaf-conifer stands is still scarce. Therefore a competitive interactions study was conducted to facilitate ecosystem-specific management for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. Ex Loud. Var. latifolia Engelm.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) in the sub-boreal spruce (SBS) zone of central BC. The experiment was a completely randomized block design with six different aspen densities replicated three times. Each replicate was sampled three times between ages 14 to 19 years. Pine diameter and height growth were influenced by aspen density. Our current quantitative findings suggest that lodgepole pine growth was not impacted when growing with aspen densities up to 2500 stems ha-1. Considering free growing (FTG) and not free growing (NFTG) pine at the time of trial establishment, an insignificant difference was found for DBH, height and crown volume responses. Leaf area index (LAI) and diffuse non-interceptance (DIFN) radiation were also not significantly different between FTG or NFTG trees suggesting our results exceed the current BC’s free growing standard.

There is currently a high level of concern in the western United States as many seral aspen populations are declining in vigor due to drought, ungulate browsing, and lack of disturbance. It is also highly uncertain if aspen will successfully accommodate future climate warming via migration through seedling establishment, which has been assumed to be extremely rare. In recent years, fundamental assumptions concerning aspen clonal age, regeneration, and genetic diversity have been challenged, and these findings have important implications for management and persistence of aspen in western USA forests. In this study, we compared regeneration dynamics of aspen revitalization strategies (conifer removal and prescribed fire) to unplanned wildfires of low, moderate, and high severity in the Sierra Nevada, and related multiple components of pre-fire stand composition to post-fire aspen regeneration. To better understand the viability of aspen migration to accommodate future climate warming, we examined recent events of aspen seedling establishment. We found substantial evidence that greater disturbance severity yields increased aspen sprout density and growth rates, and that live conifer and/or dead aspen basal area in a stand before a fire reduces post fire sprout density. Additionally, we found evidence that aspen seedling establishment is more common than has been assumed, and represents a viable means for aspen migration. Future climate changes will present both challenges and opportunities for aspen. Increased temperatures and drought will stress existing populations, but increased high severity fire in forested areas, may provide opportunity for successful aspen migration and genet establishment. In addition to revitalizing existing aspen stands, future management goals should include the establishment of new stands in more suitable habitat.",http://www.esajournals.org/doi/full/10.1890/ES14-00354.1,Article,2015

Still, there is a knowledge gap regarding the rhizosphere-associated bacterial communities of poplars and their dynamics during the remediation process. It is envisaged that a detailed understanding of rhizosphere-associated microbial populations will greatly contribute to a better design and implementation of rhizoremediation. To investigate the long-term succession of structural and catabolic bacterial communities in oil-polluted soil planted with hybrid poplar, we carried out a 2-year field study. Hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides) seedlings were planted in polluted soil excavated from an accidental oil-spill site. Vegetated and un-vegetated soil samples were collected for microbial community analyses at seven different time points during the course of 2 years and sampling time points were chosen to cover the seasonal variation in the boreal climate zone. Bacterial community structure was accessed by means of 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing, whereas catabolic diversity was monitored by pyrosequencing of alkane hydroxylase and extradiol dioxygenase genes. We observed a clear succession of bacterial communities on both structural and functional levels from early to late-phase communities. Sphingomonas type extradiol dioxygenases and alkane hydroxylase homologs of Rhodococcus clearly dominated the early-phase communities. The high-dominance/low-diversity functional gene communities underwent a transition to low-dominance/high-diversity communities in the late phase. These results pointed towards increased catabolic capacities and a change from specialist to generalist strategy of bacterial communities during the course of secondary succession.",Not found,Article,2015

We also examined the relationship between aspen recovery and the distribution of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) on the Yellowstone northern ungulate winter range, using ungulate fecal pile densities and annual elk count data. In 1998, 90% of young aspen were browsed and none were taller than 200 cm, the height at which aspen begin to escape from elk browsing. In 2012, only 37% in the east and 63% in the west portions of the winter range were browsed, and 65% of stands in the east had young aspen taller than 200 cm. Heights of young aspen were inversely related to browsing intensity, with the least browsing and greatest heights in the eastern portion of the range, corresponding with recent changes in elk density and distribution. In contrast with historical elk distribution (1930s–1990s), the greatest densities of elk recently (2006–2012) have been north of the park boundary (~5 elk/km2), and in the western part of the range (2–4 elk/km2), with relatively few elk in the eastern portion of the range (<2 elk/km2), even in mild winters. This redistribution of elk and decrease in density inside the park, and overall reduction in elk numbers, explain why many aspen stands have begun to recover. Increased predation pressure following the reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) in 1995–1996 played a role in these changing elk population dynamics, interacting with other influences including increased predation by bears (Ursus spp.), competition with an expanding bison population, and shifting patterns of human land use and hunting outside the park.

In this study, we investigated relationships between stand structure and ecological, climatic and disturbance factors in the southwest Yukon. We found that white spruce dominates mature forests across the landscape, but it is regenerating proportionately less than trembling aspen. Nevertheless, regeneration of all the three species was abundant following any type or severity of disturbance. Height and diameter of both species varied with several environmental variables, particularly site physiography. Mixed stands of aspen and white spruce were more productive than pure stands of aspen or spruce. However, overall productivity in mixed stand decreased when density of aspen was more than 1000 stems/ ha. These results suggested that mixed stands of deciduous and coniferous species where appropriate should be promoted maintaining aspen density below 1000 stems/ha as the productivity declined beyond this threshold. Similarly, we suggest carrying out selection harvesting of co-dominant trees and regular thinning of intermediate trees to promote the height and diameter growth of the remaining trees.",http://www.scirp.org/Journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=54995#.VVutF5NVhBc,Article,2015

Species distribution models have become a widely used tool to generate first-pass estimates of climate change impacts to species probabilities of occurrence. There are a number of technical challenges to constructing species distribution models that can be alleviated by the use of scientific workflow software. These challenges include data integration, visualization of modeled predictor–response relationships, and ensuring that models are reproducible and transferable in an adaptive natural resource management framework. We used freely available software called VisTrails Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (VisTrails:SAHM) along with a novel ecohydrological predictor dataset and the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 future climate projections to construct species distribution models for eight forest and shrub species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the Northern Rocky Mountains USA. The species considered included multiple species of sagebrush and juniper, Pinus flexilis, Pinus contorta, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Populus tremuloides, Abies lasciocarpa, Picea engelmannii, and Pinus albicaulis. Current and future species probabilities of occurrence were mapped in a GIS by land ownership category to assess the feasibility of undertaking present and future management action. Results suggested that decreasing spring snowpack and increasing late-season soil moisture deficit will lead to deteriorating habitat area for mountain forest species and expansion of habitat area for sagebrush and juniper communities. Results were consistent across nine global climate models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios. For most forest species their projected future distributions moved up in elevation from general federal to federally restricted lands where active management is currently prohibited by agency policy. Though not yet fully mature, custom scientific workflow software shows considerable promise to ease many of the technical challenges inherent in modeling the potential ecological impacts of climate change to support climate adaptation planning.",https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4ac3/d3b270d497819ed71b618df6e9c6ef778189.pdf,Article,2015

Continuous in situ measurements of whole trees during drought and as trees die hold promise to illuminate physiological pathways but are relatively rare. We monitored leaf characteristics, water use efficiency, water potentials, branch hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture, meteorological variables, and sap flux on mature healthy and sudden aspen decline-affected (SAD) trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) ramets over two growing seasons, including a severe summer drought. We calculated daily estimates of whole-ramet hydraulic conductance and modeled whole-ramet assimilation. Healthy ramets experienced rapid declines of whole-ramet conductance during the severe drought, providing an analog for what likely occurred during the previous drought that induced SAD. Even in wetter periods, SAD-affected ramets exhibited fivefold lower whole-ramet hydraulic conductance and sevenfold lower assimilation than counterpart healthy ramets, mediated by changes in leaf area, water use efficiency, and embolism. Extant differences between healthy and SAD ramets reveal that ongoing multi-year forest die-off is primarily driven by loss of whole-ramet hydraulic capability, which in turn limits assimilation capacity. Branch-level measurements largely captured whole-plant hydraulic limitations during drought and mortality, but whole-plant measurements revealed a potential role of other losses in the hydraulic continuum. Our results highlight the importance of a whole-tree perspective in assessing physiological pathways to tree mortality and indicate that the effects of mortality on these forests’ assimilation and productivity are larger than expected based on canopy leaf area differences.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-013-2875-5/fulltext.html,Article,2014

However, little is known about the specific effects of season and intensity of browsing. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of season and intensity of clipping (simulated browsing) on density and growth characteristics of suckers. Three randomly selected stands were clear-felled in mid-July 2005 and fenced. Simulated browsing intensities of 0, 20, 40, and 60% removal of the current year's growth on aspen suckers were randomly applied in early, mid, and late summers of 2006 and 2007 on permanently demarcated quadrats. Sucker density and sucker height were monitored in each quadrat. Changes in annual sucker numbers for the ends of 2006 and 2007 were compared with declines found that reflected both winter and summer (2007 only) mortality. Mortality was not found for suckers clipped in early summer compared with mortalities of 48 and 46% for mid and late summer clipped suckers, respectively. However, even at the highest mortality, there were still ample numbers (∼25,000/ha) of suckers for stand regeneration. At the end of the study, sucker height was reduced by all summer treatment intensities. After adjustment for the controls, clipping (of current year's growth) at 20 and 40% in mid and late summer resulted in suckers that were 47 and 41 cm tall, respectively. However, clipping at 60% resulted in suckers that were only 20 cm tall.

We found that forest structure explained most of the patterns in mortality indices, but that variation in growing-season vapor pressure deficit and winter precipitation over the last 20 years was important. Mortality index sensitivity to precipitation was highest in forests where aspen exhibited high densities, relative basal areas, quadratic mean diameters, and productivities, whereas sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit was highest in young forest stands. These results indicate that the effects of drought on mortality may be mediated by forest stand development, competition with encroaching conifers, and physiological vulnerabilities of large trees to drought.

The degree of succession to conifer throughout each aspen stand was spatially heterogeneous. Patches of pure aspen were rare. Stand density index (SDI) reached an upper limit of 1700 in pure aspen. As composition shifted in favor of conifer, SDI approached or attained a maximum of 2500 in some plots. Stand density and species composition data were tested as predictors of conifer and aspen regeneration densities in each plot. Conifer seedlings had an average density of 3261 ha-1; they were most abundant in aspen-dominated areas of any density, and in conifer-dominated areas of higher density. Aspen regeneration had an average density of 3211 ha-1 and was one order of magnitude less frequent in areas of pure conifer versus areas of pure aspen, but remained relatively abundant in most areas. Aspen saplings were rare (average density of 42 ha-1 for saplings 10-15 cm DBH), especially at high stand densities or in areas where conifers dominated.

Although livestock use was regulated following establishment of the refuge in 1936, low levels of aspen recruitment continued. After termination of livestock grazing in 1990, aspen recruitment on the refuge increased (p < 0.05) by more than an order of magnitude in comparison to levels occurring during the previous half-century of regulated grazing.

We characterized the age structure of aspen trees on the Uncompahgre Plateau in western Colorado, USA, to inform collaborative efforts of landscape-scale forest restoration. Over 1000 cores from 51 locations showed few aspen older than 140 years (<0.5% for aspen numbers, <2.5% of aspen basal area). Heavy recruitment in the late 1800s (following the last major fires) led to cohorts from 100 to 140 years of age that account for 15% of current aspen numbers and 40% of current aspen basal area. Perhaps the most important character of the current age structure is a relatively low number of aspen younger than 50 years; normal rates of tree survivorship in coming decades will lead to a substantial decline in aspen on the Plateau as these cohorts progress into older age classes. Patterns of aspen ages on the Uncompahgre Plateau differ substantially from those on the Kaibab Plateau and in Rocky Mountain National Park, owing the varying importance in space and time of driving factors. Landscape-scale increases in aspen regeneration (from major events such as fire) would be necessary to moderate the long-term decline in aspen on the Uncompahgre Plateau.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjfr-2014-0017#.VWioWlxVhBd,Article,2014

However, little attention has actually been given to the growth response of aspen to partial harvesting. This is the first study to report on tree-level volume growth response of aspen after partial or variable retention harvesting in the Canadian boreal forest. During the winter of 1998–1999, an uncut control, clearcut and two partial harvesting treatments – 1/3 partial cut (1/3PC, 33% BA removal using low thin); 2/3 partial cut (2/3PC, 61% BA removal using high thin) – were applied in 75 year old aspen-dominated mixedwood stands in a complete randomized block design. Twelve years after treatment application, 27 dominant and 27 co-dominant trees were collected from unharvested controls and the two partial cut treatments for stem analysis. Annual volume increment (AVI) of individual stems was analyzed as a function of treatment, tree social status, pre-treatment growth, time since treatment application (1–12 years) and neighborhood competition. The latter was estimated using a variety of neighborhood competition indices (NCI). There was no evidence of initial growth stagnation after partial harvesting applications. Only the most severe treatment of partial harvesting (2/3 PC) resulted in an increase in volume increment relative to trees in control stands. Annual increase in volume in the 2/3 partial cut was 25.6% higher than controls over 12 years. AVI of dominant trees was higher by 16.2 dm3 yr−1 than that of co-dominants and was proportional to pre-treatment volume growth. No interaction between treatment and social status or pre-treatment growth was observed. The overall results indicate that competition for resources in these stands is essentially size symmetrical. These results should contribute to the development of silviculture prescriptions that aim to maintain both stand productivity and biological legacies.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714002837,Article,2014

This recognition has generated interest in ecosystem management approaches that include diversifying and adapting silvicultural practices, including partial harvesting. The effects of partial harvesting on stand dynamics was assessed over a 12-year period in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) dominated stands in northwestern Quebec, Canada. Four treatments were tested: clearcuts (100% basal area (BA) removal); 1/3 partial cut (1/3 PC, 33% BA removal using low thin); 2/3 partial cut (2/3 PC, 61% BA removal using high thin) and controls (0% removal). Aspen sapling recruitment was directly affected by harvesting intensity with 1/3 and 2/3 partial cuts generating 5% and 56%, respectively, of aspen sapling densities in clearcuts. Aspen sapling recruitment increased continuously following clearcut and partial cut treatments with no significant mortality in the sapling layer over the 12-year period. Recruitment of conifer saplings also increased with time and was significantly higher in the two partial cuts than in the clearcut treatment. Twelve years after treatments, mortality of residual aspen stems (⩾10 cm DBH) reached 250 stems ha−1 12 yr−1 in controls, compared to 106, and 170 stems ha−1 12 yr−1 in 1/3 PC, and 2/3 PC stands, respectively. Initially (1–3 years after treatments), higher overstory aspen mortality was associated with the 2/3 PC treatment. Aspen mortality was strongly associated with small-sized merchantable stems (10–19.9 cm DBH) regardless of treatment. Both partial harvesting treatments had the effect of maintaining mountain maple (Acer spicatum Lamb.), a shade-tolerant, high woody shrub, at densities similar to those in control stands whereas recruitment of mountain maple saplings was negligible in clearcuts due to high aspen recruitment. Our results indicate that (i) heavy-high partial harvesting promotes sapling recruitment of both aspen and conifers when advance regeneration of the latter is present, (ii) because aspen sucker response can be controlled by varying harvesting intensities and stem selection, it is possible to create a range of mixedwood conditions, depending on whether mixed, structurally complex or more regular aspen-dominated stands are desired, and (iii) on rich mixedwood sites, tall woody shrubs could hinder desirable partial harvesting outcomes.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811271400365X,Article,2014

In the Sierra Nevada, as throughout much of western North America, much of aspen habitat is in poor health. Because of the high ecological value of healthy aspen, and its limited extent on the landscape, restoration to reverse the decline and improve stand health has become a management priority in the region. To evaluate the ecological effects of mechanically removing competing conifers to restore aspen in the Sierra Nevada, we compared vegetation characteristics and bird abundance in treated and untreated aspen stands on the Lassen National Forest before and up to 13 years after mechanical conifer removal. Treatments reduced total canopy cover and increased herbaceous cover and the number of aspen stems, while shrub and overstory aspen covers were unchanged. Of 10 aspen focal bird species, 7 increased in abundance following treatment relative to controls, including all species associated with early seral aspen habitat and cavity nesting species; none declined. In contrast, of the six conifer focal species, the four associated with denser conifer habitat declined as a result of the treatments. The two species associated with conifer edges and understory cover increased. Our results demonstrate mechanical conifer removal treatments can provide ecologically meaningful changes in habitat for the avian community and are an effective tool for restoring ecological values of degraded aspen habitat for birds in the Sierra Nevada.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rec.12114/abstract,Article,2014

We examined potential impacts of the procurement of forest-derived bioenergy, a change in land use that has been suggested as a climate change mitigation strategy, on the productivity and structural development of aspen-dominated ecosystems. Specifically, we tested the effects of two factors: organic matter removal (stem-only harvest, whole-tree harvest, whole-tree harvest plus forest floor removal) and soil compaction (light, moderate, and heavy) over time. This range of treatments, applied across three sites dominated by aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) but with different soil textures, allowed us to characterize how disturbance severity influences ecosystem recovery. Disturbance severity significantly affected above-ground biomass production and forest structural development with responses varying among sites. At the Huron National Forest (sandy soils), the removal of harvest residues reduced above-ground biomass production, but no negative effect was observed following whole-tree harvest at the Ottawa and Chippewa National Forests (clayey and loamy soils, respectively) relative to stem-only harvest. Maximum diameter and the density of stems greater than 5 cm DBH exhibited negative responses to increased disturbance severity at two sites, indicating that structural development may be slowed. Overall, results suggest that disturbance severity related to procuring harvest residues for bioenergy production may impact future productivity and development, depending on site conditions and quality.",http://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2014/nrs_2014_curzon_001.pdf?,Article,2014

The wind speeds necessary for crowning (crown-to-crown fire spread) and torching (surface to crown fire spread) were evaluated to test the hypothesis that predicted fire behavior is influenced by the proportion of aspen in the stand. Results showed a strong effect of species composition on crowning, but only under moderate fire weather, where aspen-dominated stands were unlikely to crown or torch. Although rarely observed in actual fires, conifer-dominated stands were likely to crown but not to torch, an example of “hysteresis” in crown fire behavior. Results support the hypothesis that potential crown fire behavior varies across a gradient of aspen dominance and fire weather, where it was likely under extreme and severe fire weather, and unlikely under moderate and high fire weather.

Recent aspen mortality has been linked to drought stress and elevated temperatures characteristic of conditions expected under climate change, but the role of individual aspen tree growth patterns in contributing to recent tree mortality is less well known. We used tree-ring data to investigate the relationship between an individual aspen tree's lifetime growth patterns and mortality. Surviving aspen trees had consistently higher average growth rates for at least 100 years than dead trees. Contrary to observations from late successional species, slow initial growth rates were not associated with a longer lifespan in aspen. Aspen trees that died had slower lifetime growth and slower growth at various stages of their lives than those that survived. Differences in average diameter growth between live and dead trees were significant (? = 0.05) across all time periods tested. Our best logistical model of aspen mortality indicates that younger aspen trees with lower recent growth rates and higher frequencies of abrupt growth declines had an increased risk of mortality. Our findings highlight the need for species-specific mortality functions in forest succession models. Size-dependent mortality functions suitable for late successional species may not be appropriate for species with different life history strategies.

7354,Jason Kirkey,Rapid Assessment of Ecological Resilience in Aspen Communities,Prescott College,Not found,Not found,194,Not found,"In some regions of the West, quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) has been declining after more than a century of changing human land-use patterns associated with urbanization, fire suppression, predator extirpation, and agriculture. More recently, episodes of large-scale decline, such as Sudden Aspen Decline (SAD), have been identified in association with drought and other inciting and predisposing factors. Although in many instances decline has been overstated, aspen ecosystems are expected to continue to be vulnerable to climate change and perturbing trends in human land-use patterns. Restoring processes and structures associated with resilience to aspen communities would aid in making them more resilient to future SAD-inciting factors. In this thesis I review the literature on aspen decline, explore the current use of rapid assessment tools in aspen research, identify key indicators of resilience in aspen, and propose a Community-level Aspen Resilience Assessment Tool (CARAT). Aspen decline is a complex and context-dependent phenomenon with multiple inciting and predisposing factors. Climate change-induced drought is a major factor in aspen decline, in addition to chronic ungulate herbivory, habitat fragmentation, fire suppression, and other alterations to stand ecology. Future increases in environmental stressors, such as climate change-induced drought (Worrall et al. 2013) and human land-use patterns associated with urban development and agricultural expansion (Hilty et al. 2006), may require efforts aimed at the conservation and restoration of processes, functions, and structures that will maintain the resilience of aspen communities. An aspen conservation approach that focuses on restoring resilience may prove to be the most robust strategy to maintain aspen communities in the face of uncertain future environmental stressors. Restoring fire regimes and taking action to ease the stress of herbivory on aspen can be instituted through a number of management strategies in both wilderness areas and working landscapes. I present recommendations, such as restoring ecologically effective populations of wolves (Canis lupus) where possible, and implementing prescribed burns, coppicing, and strategically placed exclosures. A rapid assessment tool of resilience in aspen communities would be valuable to conservation and restoration work. Landscape-level, coarse-scale assessments are commonly used to assess cover changes in aspen research to identify decline. I present a review of the literature pertaining to the use of satellite imaging, aerial photography and surveys, and repeat photography in aspen research. While these are ideal tools for detecting cover changes over large areas, they are limited in scale and to documenting exterior stand structures (i.e., canopy and vertical edge structures), and may be inadequate to assess aspen resilience. In order to develop a community-level rapid assessment tool for aspen resilience, I review 6 factors associated with aspen resilience: climate, disturbance, predation, ecophysiology, genetics, and connectivity. These factors are synergistic and interactive. The criteria I use to determine whether they are suitable resilience indicators for use in a rapid assessment tool are 1) is it feasible to rapidly assess the indicator at the community-level? and 2) is the indicator manageable in the context of conservation or restoration goals? I found that the most feasible and effective indicators were predation, disturbance, and connectivity. However, due to the importance of climate, it is essential that it be taken into account in both the application and interpretation of the results of this tool. I propose a resilience index that measures resilience on a 3-point scale, where 1 is the least resilient and 3 is the most. For each indicator, I identify a set of measurable variables. For predation I propose to use wolf population, elk (Cervus elaphus) population density, and browse intensity. For disturbance, I propose to use fire history. I propose to measure connectivity using road density. Finally, I propose to measure general aspen ecology using aspen recruitment ratio, aspen regeneration, and conifer canopy cover. I was unable to validate my rapid assessment tool within the scope of this thesis. Validation of this tool would be the subject of further research, in the form of PhD studies, to determine its effectiveness in measuring resilience. If effective, this tool could be valuable in guiding conservation actions to help make aspen communities more resilient to stressors.",http://pqdtopen.proquest.com/doc/1535273421.html?FMT=ABS,Article,2014

In the DMPF, the majority of stands were currently old and near the end of the sampled yield curve. We incorporated aspen and aspen–mixedwood Permanent Sample Plot remeasurement data, aged up to 200 years old, into the yield curves. This extended the sampled volume–age data of the yield curves from 120 to 200 years old. The recent discovery of multi-cohort aspen and mixedwood stands was also incorporated into modelling the Future Forest Condition of the Sustainable Forest Management Plan. Multi-cohort stand dynamics replaced previous modelling assumptions of single-cohort, even-aged stands “breaking up” and suffering catastrophic loss (i.e., death age) where volume equals zero at stand ages 140 years or older. Modelling the multi-cohort stand dynamics resulted in a significantly different Future Forest Condition due to: maintenance of a continuous forest canopy over the entire landscape; higher modelled biodiversity in older stands due to multiple canopies, abundant snags, and coarse woody debris; and the avoidance of a large age class imbalance due to stands being available for harvest longer, but at a lower volume.",http://pubs.cif-ifc.org/doi/abs/10.5558/tfc2014-010,Article,2014

Aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings were subjected to defoliation treatments by removing 50, 75 % or all of the leaves. Root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) was sharply reduced in plants defoliated for 1 day and 1 week. The decrease in L pr could not be prevented by stem girdling and it was accompanied in one-day-defoliated plants by a large decrease in the root expression of PIP1,2 aquaporin and an over twofold decrease in hydraulic conductivity of root cortical cells (L pc). Contrary to L pr and L pc, 50 and 75 % defoliation treatments profoundly increased leaf lamina conductance (K lam) after 1 day and this increase was similar in magnitude for both defoliation treatments. Transpiration rates (E) rapidly declined after the removal of 75 % of leaves. However, E increased by over twofold in defoliated plants after 1 day and the increases in E and K lam were accompanied by five- and tenfold increases in the leaf expression of PIP2;4 in 50 and 75 % defoliation treatments, respectively. Defoliation treatments also stimulated net photosynthesis after 1 day and 3 weeks, although the increase was not as high as E. Leaf water potentials remained relatively stable following defoliation with the exception of a small decrease 1 day after defoliation which suggests that root water transport did not initially keep pace with the increased transpirational water loss. The results demonstrate the importance of root and leaf hydraulic properties in plant responses to defoliation and point to the involvement of PIP aquaporins in the early events following the loss of leaves.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957702,Article,2014

The effects of fire on aspen regeneration density and height were variable within and among sites. Post-fire aspen regeneration density generally decreased with greater conifer basal area (rs = −0.73), but there was a wide range of aspen regeneration densities (4000 to 36 667 stems ha-1) at transects with no live conifers post-fire. The height of aspen regeneration increased as a function of increasing years-since-fire (1 yr to 11 yr), but heavy browsing by mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus Rafinesque) may alter future growth trajectories. Median percent of aspen regeneration browsed was high in burned (91%) and unburned (81%) transects. Only 7% (282 stems ha-1 to 333 stems ha-1) of post-fire aspen regeneration in 11- year old burns exceeded the height necessary to escape mule deer browsing (150 cm). Browsing may also be altering aspen growth form, such that multi-stemmed aspen regeneration was positively associated with proportion of aspen regeneration browsed.

Defoliation plots of 15 × 15 m were established on three sites, together with associated control stands of pure trembling aspen. In 2007, root collar diameters were measured and positions of all trees were mapped prior defoliation. Severe FTC defoliation was simulated for three successive years (2007–2009) by manually removing all leaves from all but 7–10% of the trees present in the defoliation plots. Yearly surveys of growth and mortality were conducted until 2010 to evaluate defoliation effects on defoliated as well as surrounding undefoliated trees. In absence of other factors, growth and mortality of trembling aspen decreased and increased, respectively, after defoliation. Our study further revealed that small diameter trees died after one year of artificial defoliation, while larger-diameter trees died after repeated defoliations. Distributions of tree mortality tended to be aggregated at small scales (<5 >m), corroborating gap patterns observed in mature stands following FTC outbreaks. This experiment revealed that trembling aspen mortality can be directly attributed solely to defoliation. Repeated defoliations during FTC outbreaks have the potential to profoundly modify stand productivity and structure by reducing tree growth and increasing tree mortality in the absence of predisposing factors.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X13002014,Article,2014

Spatial heterogeneity of microbial populations, contaminants and soil chemical parameters on such sites is a major hurdle in optimizing and implementing an appropriate bioremediation regime. We performed a grid-based sampling of an aged creosote-contaminated site followed by geostatistical modelling to illustrate the spatial patterns of microbial diversity and activity and to relate these patterns to the distribution of pollutants. Spatial distribution of bacterial groups unveiled patterns of niche differentiation regulated by patchy distribution of pollutants and an east-to-west pH gradient at the studied site. Proteobacteria clearly dominated in the hot spots of creosote pollution, whereas the abundance of Actinobacteria, TM7 and Planctomycetes was considerably reduced from the hot spots. The pH preferences of proteobacterial groups dominating in pollution could be recognized by examining the order and family-level responses. Acidobacterial classes came across as generalists in hydrocarbon pollution whose spatial distribution seemed to be regulated solely by the pH gradient. Although the community evenness decreased in the heavily polluted zones, basal respiration and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis rates were higher, indicating the adaptation of specific indigenous microbial populations to hydrocarbon pollution. Combining the information from the kriged maps of microbial and soil chemistry data provided a comprehensive understanding of the long-term impacts of creosote pollution on the subsurface microbial communities.

Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings with different NSC and N reserves accumulated during the previous growing season were generated in the greenhouse. Based on NSC and N contents, seedlings were assigned to one of three reserve statuses: Low N–Low NSC, High N–Medium NSC, or High N–High NSC. In the subsequent growing season, half of the seedlings in each reserve status was subjected to defoliation by forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) while the other half was left untreated. Following defoliation, the effect of reserves was measured on foliar chemistry (N, NSC) and caterpillar performance (larval development). Due to their importance in herbivore feeding, we also quantified concentrations of phenolic glycoside compounds in foliage. Seedlings in Low N-Low NSC reserve status contained higher amounts of induced phenolic glycosides, grew little, and supported fewer caterpillars. In contrast, aspen seedlings in High N-Medium or High NSC reserve statuses contained lower amounts of induced phenolic glycosides, grew faster, and some of the caterpillars which fed on these seedlings developed up to their fourth instar. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis indicated that foliar phenolic glycoside concentration was related to reserve chemistry (NSC, N). Overall, these results demonstrate that reserves accumulated during the previous growing season can influence tree defense and growth in the subsequent growing season. Additionally, our study concluded that the NSC/N ratio of reserves in the previous growing season represents a better measure of resources available for use in defense and growth than the foliar NSC/N ratios.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-013-0374-0,Article,2014

In west Texas, isolated, outlier stands occur in the Guadalupe, Davis, and Chisos Mountains at an elevation of approximately 2300 m. This study utilized seven microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) to examine leaf samples from 10 widely separated stems in 10 isolated P. tremuloides individual stands within the Davis Mountains to determine the level of clonal and genetic diversity. We then examined differentiation among stands. Each stem sampled within a stand was genetically identical to all stems examined in that stand or was part of a clone. There were eight genetically identical clones from these ten stands, with three stands being genetically identical or part of the same clone. Many of the genotypes shared several of the same alleles and the remaining alleles were only a few base pairs apart. Some of these alleles have been previously identified in other western North American P. tremuloides stands.

In 1995–1996 gray wolves (Canis lupus) were reintroduced, joining bears (Ursus spp.) and cougars (Puma concolor) to complete the guild of large carnivores that prey on elk. This was followed by a marked decline in elk density and change in elk distribution during the years 1997–2012, due in part to increased predation. We hypothesized that these changes would result in less browsing and an increase in height of young aspen. In 2012, we sampled 87 randomly selected stands in northern Yellowstone, and compared our data to baseline measurements from 1997 and 1998. Browsing rates (the percentage of leaders browsed annually) in 1997–1998 were consistently high, averaging 88%, and only 1% of young aspen in sample plots were taller than 100 cm; none were taller than 200 cm. In 2012, browsing rates were much lower at 44%, and young aspen were taller on average with 34% >100 cm and 5% >200 cm. Most (62%) of the variation in height of young aspen in 2012 was explained by browsing intensity. Furthermore, in 2012, 25% of stands had at least five aspen saplings tall enough to escape elk browsing (⩾200 cm spring height), a condition that has not occurred for decades and happened despite a recent drought. Sapling recruitment did not increase until browsing decreased, following substantial changes in elk density and distribution, and was not significantly related to stand productivity or climate fluctuations.

In both North America and Europe, however, aspen are threatened by a variety of human impacts: clear-felling, land development, water diversions, fire suppression, and both wild and domestic ungulate herbivory. We conducted a landscape assessment of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) for the purpose of identifying key components of resilience. Specifically, we strove to test novel measures linking plant-animal interactions, compare crucial functional differences in aspen types, and make appropriate restorative recommendations based on the outcome of these assessments. Location: The Book Cliffs region of eastern Utah and western Colorado, USA. Methods: Seventy-seven one hectare plots were sampled for forest structure, composition, regeneration and recruitment, landscape elements, browse level, and herbivore use. Use was determined by counting the number of pellet groups by ungulate species at each sample location. We tested the efficacy of a visual stand condition rating system when compared to objective metrics. A series of non-parametric analyses were used to compare functional aspen types and stand condition groups by key variables. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) allowed us to explore all our data to find the most critical measures of aspen stand conditions for the purpose of better informing future aspen monitoring. Results: Results indicate that plots differed significantly by seral or stable aspen functional types, stand condition rating, and browse species use. Ordination analysis revealed that regeneration level and herbivore use were the strongest objective indicators of aspen stand conditions, while the stand condition rating proved a valuable subjective index of forest status. While ungulate herbivory of aspen is problematic internationally, our results show acute impacts where moderate slopes, relatively low water availability, and intense browsing predominate. Conclusions: Appropriate measures of aspen communities, informed by crucial functional divisions, have allowed us to gain a clear understanding of conditions across this large landscape. Overall, aspen in our study landscape is highly vulnerable to collapse due to narrow physiographic and climate limitations and browse levels. Without herbivory reduction, future conservation in such areas will be strained and widespread system failure may occur.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8299&context=aspen_bib,Article,Spring 2014

However, management of distinct communities has long relied on a single aspen-to-conifer successional model. We examine a variety of aspen-dominated stand types in the western portion of its range as ecological systems, avoiding an exclusive focus on seral dynamics or single-species management. We build a case for a large-scale functional aspen typology based on the existing literature. Aspen functional types are defined as aspen communities that differ markedly in their physical and biological processes. The framework presented here describes two “functional types” and seven embedded “subtypes”: seral (boreal and montane), stable (parkland, Colorado Plateau, elevation and aspect limited, and terrain isolated), and a crossover seral-stable subtype (riparian). The assessment hinges on a matrix comparing proposed functional types across a suite of environmental characteristics. Differences among functional groups based on physiological and climatic conditions, stand structures and dynamics, and disturbance types and periodicity are described herein. We further examine management implications and challenges, such as human alterations, ungulate herbivory, and climate futures, that affect the functionality of these aspen systems. The functional framework lends itself well to stewardship and research that seek to understand and emulate ecological processes rather than combat them. We see advantages of applying this approach to other widespread forest communities that engender diverse functional adaptations.",http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/saf/fs/2014/00000060/00000002/art00016,Article,2014

Aspen clones regenerate if sprouts are produced that grow into recruitment stems (>2 m tall) and replace the mature overstory. Beaver reintroduced in 1991 to Eagle Creek on the NYWR facilitated aspen restoration by removing overstory trees and increasing sprouting. However, intense ungulate browsing, primarily from the Northern Yellowstone elk herd, was preventing aspen recruitment in Eagle Creek as of 2005. Since 2005, wolf predation has contributed to a 56% decrease in this elk herd. We investigated the effects of beaver reintroduction, ungulate herbivory, and predator-mediated declines in elk numbers on aspen regeneration in Eagle Creek from 1997 to 2012. Aerial photos of Eagle Creek in 2005 and 2011 showed that the aspen overstory has not been replaced 21 years after beaver reintroduction (p > 0.05). Sprouting and recruitment were investigated using 4-m radius circular plots (n = 31) established throughout Eagle Creek in 1997 and monitored annually until 2012. Beaver activity stimulated sprouting in 71% of these plots. In 2012, 77% of the plots had ≥1 recruitment stem and 75% of the paired plots associated with exclosures (n = 16) had aspen stems with an average height ≥2 m. Recent increases in aspen recruitment in Eagle Creek indicate that aspen communities are regenerating. This has likely resulted from decreased ungulate browsing pressure on aspen saplings from 2005 to 2012.

Researchers are faced with data management and analytical scales that are increasing by orders of magnitude. With such dramatic advances comes a need to understand biases and error rates, which can be propagated and magnified in large-scale data acquisition and processing. Here we assess genomic sampling biases and the effects of various population-level data filtering strategies in a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) protocol. We focus on data from two species of Populus, because this genus has a relatively small genome and is emerging as a target for population genomic studies. We estimate the proportions and patterns of genomic sampling by examining the Populus trichocarpa genome (Nisqually-1), and demonstrate a pronounced bias towards coding regions when using the methylation-sensitive ApeKI restriction enzyme in this species. Using population-level data from a closely related species (P. tremuloides), we also investigate various approaches for filtering GBS data to retain high-depth, informative SNPs that can be used for population genetic analyses. We find a data filter that includes the designation of ambiguous alleles resulted in metrics of population structure and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium that were most consistent with previous studies of the same populations based on other genetic markers. Analyses of the filtered data (27,910 SNPs) also resulted in patterns of heterozygosity and population structure similar to a previous study using microsatellites.

For temperate and boreal species, the timing of early spring development plays a key role in plant–herbivore interactions and can influence insect performance, outbreak dynamics, and plant damage. We used a field-based, meso-scale free-air forest warming experiment (B4WarmED) to examine the effects of elevated temperature on the phenology and performance of forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) in relation to the phenology of two host trees, aspen (Populus tremuloides) and birch (Betula papyrifera). Results of our 2-year study demonstrated that spring phenology advanced for both insects and trees, with experimentally manipulated increases in temperature of 1.7 and 3.4 °C. However, tree phenology advanced more than insect phenology, resulting in altered phenological synchrony. Specifically, we observed a decrease in the time interval between herbivore egg hatch and budbreak of aspen in both years and birch in one year. Moreover, warming decreased larval development time from egg hatch to pupation, but did not affect pupal mass. Larvae developed more quickly on aspen than birch, but pupal mass was not affected by host species. Our study reveals that warming-induced phenological shifts can alter the timing of ecological interactions across trophic levels. These findings illustrate one mechanism by which climate warming could mediate insect herbivore outbreaks, and also highlights the importance of climate change effects on trophic interactions.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-014-2960-4,Article,2014

Belowground plant defenses are likely important mediators of root-feeding herbivores that can strongly influence plant fitness. We used a common garden of potted aspen trees to explore the individual and interactive effects of soil nutrient availability, foliar damage, genotype, and their interactions, on concentrations of phytochemicals in aspen roots. Our common garden experiment employed 12 aspen genotypes that were planted into either low- or high-nutrient soil environments. Half of the trees were subjected to defoliation for two successive years, while the others were protected from damage. At the end of the growing season after the second defoliation, we harvested the trees to obtain root samples for which we assessed levels of phenolic glycosides, condensed tannins, nitrogen, and starch. Phenolic glycosides were most affected by genotype, while the other root phytochemicals were most responsive to soil nutrient conditions. The effects of defoliation were observed in interaction with soil nutrient environment and/or genotype. Interestingly, the effect of defoliation on phenolic glycosides was mediated by soil nutrients, whereas the effect of defoliation on condensed tannins was observed in concert with effects of both soil nutrients and genotype. Comparison of data from this study with an earlier, related study revealed that concentrations of phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins are lower in roots than leaves, and less responsive to defoliation. That soil nutrient environment affects root phytochemical concentrations is not unexpected given the intimate association of roots and soil, but the complex interactions between soil nutrients, aboveground damage, and genotype, and their effects on root phytochemistry, are intriguing. Variation in root chemistry could have wide-reaching effects on soil microbial communities, nutrient cycling, and herbivores. Additionally, the response of phytochemicals to damage across organs can link different, spatially separated herbivores as they use different parts of the same plant resource.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-013-0371-3,Article,2014

The objective of this study was to understand how variability in fire regimes influences forest regeneration and recruitment patterns and wildlife activity at large temporal and spatial scales. Across 25 fires in five National Forests (Uinta-Wasatch-Cache NF, Ashley NF, Fishlake NF, Dixie NF, and Manti-La Sal NF) in the state of Utah, we examined aspen regeneration and recruitment levels, and wildlife and livestock fecal group counts along belt transects that spanned gradients of fire size and severity. Forest cover change was assessed by comparing pre-fire and post-fire satellite images. The fires dated from 1992 to 2002 and were at least 10 years old when this study was conducted. Fire size and severity were positively related to aspen regeneration (density of saplings) and recruitment (saplings >2 m in height). There was a significant fire size and severity interaction effect on aspen regeneration, such that the positive influence of fire size increased with greater fire severity (R2 = 0.40, P < 0.001). Change in the extent of aspen cover was not correlated with fire size. Deer and cattle became more dispersed with increasing fire size and severity, but elk activity showed no difference. Deer preferred low severity burn patches in smaller fires, but appeared to avoid low severity patches as fires became larger. Our results suggest that fire size and severity are important ecological filters that can interact to affect forest development and the distribution and abundance of large herbivores. Effective management of forest systems in response to altered fire regimes will require an understanding of the legacy effects of fire size and severity at the landscape scale.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714003673,Article,2014

I used molecular tools to identify individual clones in a natural population of aspen in southern Utah and detected high and low levels of clonal diversity within stands. Stands with high clonal diversity were located in areas with a more frequent fire history, indicating that fires may have prepared sites for seed germination and establishment over time. Conversely, areas of low clonal diversity corresponded to areas with less frequent fire. The same molecular tools were then used to investigate clonal interactions/succession over relatively recent time. For this portion of the study I sampled small, medium, and large aspen ramets (stems) at 25 subplots within spatially separated one-hectare plots, and mapped the clonal identities. I found that approximately 25% of the clones appeared to be spreading into adjacent clones, while 75% of the clones had a stationary pattern. In the final portion of the study, I again used molecular tools to identify aspen clones and investigated tradeoffs between growth and defense chemistry in mature, naturally-occurring trees. Growth was estimated using a ten-year basal area increment, and the percent dry weight of salicortin, tremulacin, and condensed tannins was measured in the same trees. Overall I discovered evidence for a tradeoff between growth and salicortin/tremulacin, and a marginally significant but positive relationship between growth and condensed tannins.",http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2736&context=etd,Thesis/Dissertation,2013

One recently introduced conservation measure in production forestry is retention of trees at clearcutting to benefit flora and fauna. Aspen Populus tremula is often retained for conservation purposes since it is a key tree species for biodiversity with many associated species, a number of which are red-listed. Still, the importance to biodiversity of aspen trees retained at harvest is largely unknown. In 1994, a transplantation experiment with the old-growth forest indicator lichen Lobaria pulmonaria was set up on 280 aspens at 35 sites in east-central Sweden with a total of 1120 transplants, with the aim to assess the habitat suitability of retained aspens following harvest. After 14 years 23% of L. pulmonaria transplants remained, with a significantly higher survival on retained aspens than on aspens in the surrounding forest, especially on the northern side of stems. Transplants were also more vital on northern than on southern sides of stems. There was no difference in survival or vitality of transplants between dispersed aspens and aspens in groups. Results largely agreed with a re-inventory made already after two years but the importance of the north side of retention trees became evident for species survival only after 14 years, indicating that to gain deeper insights longer time-spans may be necessary. This study, which is the longest lichen transplantation time-series from a well replicated experiment so far published, shows that retention of trees at harvest may be an efficient conservation action.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112712007281,Article,2013

Available SO42− (as the sum of soluble and adsorbed SO42−) accumulated in the soil near tree boles of both species, reflecting the influence of canopy intercepted SO42−. In jack pine stands, pH and soluble base cation concentrations decreased towards tree boles due to increased SO42− leaching; the reverse was found in aspen stands due to deposition of base cations leached from the canopy. As a result, Ca/Al ratios in the soluble fraction in soils near jack pine boles were 5–20 times lower than that near aspen boles. The Ca/Al ratio did not reach the critical limits of 1.0 for soil solution (ranged from 1.0 to 4.1) or 0.5 for fine roots (0.7–7.9) in the studied watersheds. However, Aln+ concentrations in the soil solution ranged from 0.2 to 4.1 mg L−1 in NE7 and from 0.1 to 8.5 mg L−1 in SM8 that can inhibit the growth of white spruce (Picea glauca) seedlings that commonly succeed aspen in upland sites in the AOSR.

Watershed NE7 was exposed to greater amounts of acid deposition due to its closeness to the mining and upgrading area. The δ15N in the forest floor was lower (p < 0.05) in NE7 (ranged from −1.42 to −0.87‰) than in SM8 (−0.54 to 1.43‰), implying a greater amount of recent deposition of 15N-depleted N in NE7. Tree ring δ13C gradually decreased over time for both tree species/watersheds, indicating the influence of 13C-depleted CO2 emitted from industrial sources. Tree ring N concentration and δ15N were not different between watersheds and did not significantly change with time. Interestingly, however, the difference between watersheds (NE7–SM8) that is expressed as Diff_N (for N) increased with concomitant decreases in Diff_δ15N over time, implying greater increases in 15N-depleted N input in NE7 than in SM8. Such trends were stronger in aspen stands (R2 = 0.64 and p < 0.001 for Diff_N andR2 = 0.44 and p < 0.01 for Diff_δ15N between 1964 and 2009) than in jack pine stands.

In this paper we explore the linkages among past climate, vegetation, and fire regimes using a high-resolution pollen and charcoal reconstruction from Morris Pond located on the Markagunt Plateau in southwestern Utah, USA. A regime shift detection algorithm was applied to background charcoal accumulation to define where statistically significant shifts in fire regimes occurred. The early Holocene was characterized by greater amounts of summer precipitation and less winter precipitation than modern. Ample forest fuel and warm summer temperatures allowed for large fires to occur. The middle Holocene was a transitional period between vegetation conditions and fire disturbance. The late Holocene climate is characterized as cool and wet reflecting an increase in snow cover, which reduced opportunities for fire despite increased availability of fuels. Similarities between modern forest fuel availability and those of the early Holocene suggest that warmer summers projected for the 21st century may yield substantial increases in the recurrence and ecological impacts of fire when compared to the fire regime of the last millennium.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033589412001275,Article,2013

A greenhouse study was conducted using forest mineral soil contaminated by heavy fuel oil and planted with hybrid aspen. The aim was to compare the bacterial succession in oil- and plant-amended ecosystems. Samples were taken weekly from bulk and rhizosphere soil. The oil degrading bacteria were enumerated by most-probable number assay and the bacterial community structures were determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the 16S rRNA and extradiol dioxygenase genes. Hierarchical clustering of phylotypes coupled with heatmap analysis of T-RFLP fingerprints revealed patterns of co-occurrence of bacterial groups. Co-occurring OTUs present only in the oil treatments were observed from both 16S rRNA and extradiol dioxygenase gene heatmaps, which represent the bacteria adapted to oil pollution. A rhizosphere effect was detected in oil-contaminated soil with elevated bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity and MPN counts. The forest soil was dominated by two phyla, Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria, while Betaproteobacteria were clearly activated by addition of oil. Directional succession of bacterial communities was unique to oil treatments, shown by the 16S rRNA gene community structure.

In one-family trials, higher germination and higher survival rates were observed in higher temperature (C1700), leading to taller seedlings. European aspen × hybrid aspen individuals (Asp × Hyb) had a higher survival rate and taller seedlings than Asp, Hyb × Asp or Hyb × Hyb individuals. The difference between Asp × Hyb and Hyb × Asp was pronounced. Both growth conditions and genotype (i.e., hybrid cross) had strong effects on germination, survival rate and height of European aspen and F2-hybrid seedlings. However, the interaction of genotype and growth conditions also had a significant influence on survival rate and seedling height, but not on germination. Two-family trials involving European aspen and F2-hybrids led to significant negative effects on germination and survival rate and also facilitation effects on seedling height. Similarly, genotype had strong effects on germination and survival rate. Different genotypes and traits affected survival rate and seedling height differently in different growth conditions. These differences were more pronounced in the warmest environment, i.e., 1,700 degree days.

Reports range from declines to persisting or increasing coverage in some areas. Moreover, there is little agreement on ultimate factors driving changes. Low aspen recruitment has been attributed to climate patterns, past management, herbivore increases, competitive interactions with conifers, predator and beaver extirpation, and livestock grazing. Several of these potential causes result from direct or indirect actions of human agency. On June 27–28, 2012 a group of leading aspen ecologists from diverse backgrounds convened at the High Lonesome Ranch in western Colorado to address the state of aspen science under the title, Resilience in Quaking Aspen: restoring ecosystem processes through applied science. The purposes of this meeting were to: (a) present disciplinary updates on recent developments; (b) focus our collective understanding on determining key research gaps; and, to the extent possible, (c) develop a plan to communicate both advances and science gaps to wider audiences. Presentations and group discussions were framed mainly in the geographic context of the western US. The symposium addressed dual central themes—historical aspen cover change and ungulate herbivory—both of which have important ramifications for future aspen resilience. We also found emergent themes in disturbance, climate work, and genetic innovation. This paper presents a brief review of the state of aspen science and a synopsis of issues and needs identified at the symposium. Detailed treatments of topics mentioned here are found in accompanying articles of this volume. A key recommendation from researchers here is that there are many ‘‘aspen types’’ and novel, landscape- or aspen type-specific, approaches will be required to appropriately address this regional diversity. We further emphasize needed interdisciplinary work addressing changing climates, altered disturbance patterns, intensive herbivory, and human drivers of ecological change.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2441&context=wild_facpub,Article,2013

Kulakowski",Fire regimes of quaking aspen in the Mountain West,Forest Ecology and Management,299,1,22 - 34,Not found,"Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is the most widespread tree species in North America, and it is found throughout much of the Mountain West (MW) across a broad range of bioclimatic regions. Aspen typically regenerates asexually and prolifically after fire, and due to its seral status in many western conifer forests, aspen is often considered dependent upon disturbance for persistence. In many landscapes, historical evidence for post-fire aspen establishment is clear, and following extended fire-free periods senescing or declining aspen overstories sometimes lack adequate regeneration and are succeeding to conifers. However, aspen also forms relatively stable stands that contain little or no evidence of historical fire. In fact, aspen woodlands range from highly fire-dependent, seral communities to relatively stable, self-replacing, non-seral communities that do not require fire for persistence. Given the broad geographic distribution of aspen, fire regimes in these forests likely co-vary spatially with changing community composition, landscape setting, and climate, and temporally with land use and climate – but relatively few studies have explicitly focused on these important spatiotemporal variations. Here we reviewed the literature to summarize aspen fire regimes in the western US and highlight knowledge gaps. We found that only about one-fourth of the 46 research papers assessed for this review could be considered fire history studies (in which mean fire intervals were calculated), and all but one of these were based primarily on data from fire-scarred conifers. Nearly half of the studies reported at least some evidence of persistent aspen in the absence of fire. We also found that large portions of the MW have had little or no aspen fire history research. As a result of this review, we put forth a classification framework for aspen that is defined by key fire regime parameters (fire severity and probability), and that reflects underlying biophysical settings and correlated aspen functional types. We propose the following aspen fire regime types: (1) fire-independent, stable aspen; (2) fire-influenced, stable aspen; (3) fire-dependent, seral, conifer-aspen mix; (4) fire-dependent, seral, montane aspen-conifer; and (5) fire-dependent, seral, subalpine aspen-conifer. Closing research gaps and validating our proposed aspen fire regime classification will likely require additional site-specific research, enhanced dendrochronology techniques, charcoal and pollen record analysis, spatially-explicit modeling, and other techniques. We hope to encourage development of site-appropriate disturbance ecology characterizations, in order to aid efforts to manage and restore aspen communities and to diagnose key factors contributing to changes in aspen.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2012.11.032,Article,2013

Here, we demonstrate that growth at elevated temperatures (ambient +5 °C) affects hydraulic traits in seedlings of the deciduous boreal tree species Populus tremuloides, with the strength of the effect varying with the plant organ studied. Temperature altered the partitioning of hydraulic resistance, with greater resistance attributed to stems and less to roots in warm-grown seedlings (P < 0.02), and a 46% (but marginally significant, P = 0.08) increase in whole plant conductance at elevated temperature. Vulnerability to cavitation was greater in leaves grown at high than at ambient temperatures, but vulnerability in stems was similar between treatments. A soil–plant–atmosphere (SPA) model suggests that these coordinated changes in hydraulic physiology would lead to more frequent drought stress and reduced water-use efficiency in aspen that develop at warmer temperatures. Tissue-specific trade-offs in hydraulic traits in response to high growth temperatures would be difficult to detect when relying solely on whole plant measurements, but may have large-scale ecological implications for plant water use, carbon cycling and, possibly, plant drought survival.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2012.02557.x/abstract,Article,2013

While recent research has focused on specific failure mechanisms during drought-induced forest die-off, a broader understanding of the physiology of trees under drought, especially changes in growth and carbon allocation, is needed for determining the sensitivity of forests to drought and interacting mechanisms during forest mortality. I present here multi-tissue and high-resolution temporal dynamics of tree carbon resources during moderate experimental and natural drought in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests, a major forest type in western North America that recently experienced widespread drought-induced die-off. Drought led to substantial declines in inferred carbon uptake. Tree carbohydrate concentrations, however, largely increased in concert with substantial decreases in growth and severe declines in root biomass. These findings highlight that growth declines, especially in fine roots which are important to water uptake, and increased carbon allocation to root non-structural carbohydrates are key responses to drought in aspen and could play an important role in widespread die-off. They suggest multi-year consequences of drought and carbon-hydraulic interconnections. They underscore the need for a more integrated multi-tissue, multi-process, and multi-year perspective of climate-induced forest mortality.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-012-0421-9,Article,2012

Forest die-off will likely affect understory plant communities, which have substantial influence on regional biological diversity, ecosystem function, and land–atmosphere interactions, but how die-off alters these plant communities is largely unknown. We examined changes in understory plant communities following a widespread, drought-induced die-off of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) in the western United States. We assessed shrub and herbaceous cover and volume in quadrats in 55 plots located across a wide range of levels of aspen mortality. We measured species richness and composition of herbaceous plant communities by recording species presence and absence in 12 sets of paired (1 healthy, 1 dying) aspen plots. Although understory composition in healthy and dying stands was heterogeneous across the landscape, shrub abundance, cover, and volume were higher and abundance of herbaceous species, cover, and volume were lower in dying aspen stands. Shrub cover and volume increased from 2009 to 2011 in dying stands, which suggests that shrub growth and expansion is ongoing. Species richness of herbs declined by 23% in dying stands. Composition of herbs differed significantly between dying and healthy stands. Richness of non-native species did not differ between stand types. The understory community in dying aspen stands was not similar to other shrub-dominated plant communities in the region and may constitute a novel community. Our results suggest that changes in understory plant communities as forests die off could be a significant indirect effect of climate change on biological diversity and forest communities.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01913.x/abstract,Article,2012

Yet, provenance trials speak to the contrary and show that populations are adapted to their local climatic conditions and tend to respond differently to climate. Spatial and temporal complexity of forest productivity and climate-relationships has been globally reported and recent studies have emphasized the necessity for regional studies on forest growth dynamics of current and future populations. The objective of this study was to determine whether the main climatic and non-climatic drivers of trembling aspen (Populustremuloides Michx.) growth in Québec should be treated as regional (the study area reacts as a unique population) or local factors (the area is composed of different populations) when modeling the spatio-temporal variability of aspen productivity as measured with site index. Stem analysis data was collected from 124 trees (32 stands) that span a north-south (latitude 46–51°N) transect in western boreal Québec. Most stands were dense with cover density above 60%, even-aged, 50–90 years old, and very often mixed. The northernmost regions (latitude 48–51°N) are characterized by either organic or clay deposits, while in the south (latitude 46–48°N) till or clay deposits predominate. Climate variables that met selection criteria as major regional or local factors that influence aspenproductivity were selected. A mixed modeling approach was subsequently employed to identify the categorization unit that could be defined as a population. We then predicted variation in the random error with prior information obtained at stand level. Our results show that aspen height growth is mainly driven by annual sums of degree days and stand age. Surface deposit type, which is an indicator of soil nutritive status and moisture potential, was found to have modulated climate influence. Finally, aspen productivity is better explained with a model that assumes that specific populations have a different response function to climate and are adapted to their local climatic conditions. This has implications when predicting the response to climatic change for forest growth models that assume that conspecifics respond to climate similarly.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.06.020,Article,2012

Managing for potential woodpecker nest trees requires an understanding of factors that influence decisions by which woodpecker select trees for nest cavity excavation, including tree decay availability associated with softened heartwood and sapwood in trees. We evaluated woodpecker nest cavity excavation in relation to the nature and availability of decay in trembling aspen (Populustremuloides) using 12 years of nest and tree decay class data from British Columbia. We used a cavity-nest web to visually depict decay selection profiles for six woodpecker species and compared these woodpecker decay selection profiles to the availability of decay in aspen (96.7% of all cavity nests found), identifying the most suitable nest tree stages used by woodpeckers. The suitable woodpecker nest tree stage consists primarily of live unhealthy trees and recently dead trees (93.9% of active nests found in aspen). Compared to non-nest trees (trees within which no cavity nests were found during the study period), live trees that were used for nest cavity excavation had higher annual probabilities of entering the suitable woodpecker nest tree stage than non-nest trees, and they also had a lower probability of progressing outside of this stage. This suggests excavation decisions involve a balance of competing tradeoffs between ease of excavation and tree security. Nest trees remained within the suitable woodpecker nest tree stage for an average of 11.8 years, and almost half of this time involved live trees in an unhealthy state. We suggest that forest management guidelines that focus on retaining only dead trees to provide cavities for wildlife are missing a significant component of available and future tree cavity resources.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2012.08.021,Article,2012

A recent study in the Kaibab National Forest near Flagstaff, AZ conducted by Zegler (2011) was intended in part to examine the relationships between aspen crown dieback and mortality with predisposing stand factors and contributing damaging agents. However, the genetic diversity and clonal structure of the sample sites used in this study had not been estimated. This provided a unique opportunity to combine a genetic dataset with preexisting measurements of stand degradation and environmental conditions to test for relationships between them. The objectives of this study were 1) to estimate the genetic diversity of aspen in the study area, 2) to assess clonal structure to make inferences of historical reproductive patterns, and 3) to test for relationships between genetic diversity, clonal structure, and signs of SAD. To accomplish this, microsatellite multilocus genotypes were generated from tissue samples taken from a subset of sample sites from Zegler (2011). Analysis of the genotypes from these sites revealed an association between genotypic diversity and northerly aspect, and levels of site degradation showed a positive relationship with mean heterozygosity. I speculate that the association between genotypic diversity and northerly aspect may be due to higher rates of aspen seedling recruitment among northerly aspects, and that the relationship between heterozygosity and stand degradation results from ancient clonal lineages with both high levels of heterozygosity and poor fitness under current conditions. I conclude that conservation efforts encouraging the propagation of seedlings and younger clones would improve resistance of the greater aspen population in Kaibab National Forest to Sudden Aspen Decline.",http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/wcu/f/Dixon2012.pdf,Thesis/Dissertation,2012

In 1990, cattle were removed from a 112,500-ha national wildlife refuge in southeastern Oregon. Thereafter, we monitored changes in vegetation and bird abundance in years 1–3 (phase 1) and 10–12 (phase 2) in 17 riparian and 9 snow-pocket aspen plots. On each 1.5-ha plot, we sampled vegetation in 6 transects. Three times during each breeding season, observers recorded all birds 50 m to each side of the plot's 150-m centerline for 25 minutes. We analyzed data with multivariate analysis of variance and paired t tests with p values adjusted for multiple comparisons. In both periods, riparian and snow-pocket aspen produced extensive regeneration of new shoots ( stems/ha and 7079 stems/ha, respectively). By phase 2, a 64% increase in medium-diameter trees in riparian stands indicated successful recruitment into the overstory, but this pattern was not seen in snow-pocket stands, where the density of trees was over 2 times greater. By phase 2 in riparian and snow-pocket stands, native forb cover had increased by 68% and 57%, respectively, mesic shrub cover had increased by 29% and 58%, and sagebrush cover had decreased by 24% and 31%.

These effects are of particular concern in forests of western North America, where intensive herbivory by native and domestic ungulates has the potential to substantially reduce or eliminate deciduous, highly palatable species of aspen (Populus tremuloides), cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), and willow (Salix spp.). In turn, differential herbivory pressure may favor greater establishment of unpalatable conifers that serve as ladder fuels for stand-replacing fires. The resulting high fuel loads often require silvicultural fuels reductions to mitigate fire risk, which in turn may facilitate additional recruitment of deciduous species but also additional herbivory pressure. Potential interactions of ungulate herbivory with episodic disturbances of silviculture, fire, and other land uses are not well documented, but are thought to operate synergistically to affect forest dynamics. We evaluated individual and joint effects of ungulate herbivory and fuels reduction treatments in grand fir (Abies grandis) and Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziezii) forests that dominate large areas of interior western North America. We applied fuels reduction treatments of mechanical thinning and prescribed fire and then evaluated the responses of aspen, cottonwood, and willow species to these treatments (N = 3) versus areas of no treatment (N = 3), and to exclusion from ungulate herbivory versus areas subjected to extant herbivory by free-ranging cattle (Bos taurus), elk (Cervus elaphus), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Densities of deciduous species were >4 times higher in response to fuels reduction treatments (84.4 individuals/ha) compared to areas of no treatment (19.7 individuals/ha). Additionally, when ungulates were excluded from fuels treated sites, the density of cottonwood was >5 times higher (122.5 individuals/ha) than fuels treated sites subjected to extant herbivory (24.3 individuals/ha). Similarly, densities of Populus spp. and Salix spp. were >3 times higher (211.6 individuals/ha) on fuels treated sites excluded from ungulate herbivory versus fuels treated sites subjected to extant herbivory (66.1 stems/ha). Deciduous species subjected to extant ungulate herbivory also were significantly lower in height, canopy surface area, and canopy volume than the same species inside the ungulate exclosures. Recruitment and long-term survival of aspen, cottonwood, and willow species in coniferous forests of interior western North America require a combination of episodic disturbances such as silviculture and fire to facilitate deciduous plant recruitment, followed by reductions in grazing pressure by domestic and wild ungulates during the time intervals between episodic disturbances to facilitate plant establishment, growth and survival.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112712001843,Article,2012

Our study was conducted in the SAFE Project, a series of silvicultural experiments that tests an ecosystem management model based on natural dynamics. We found that large trembling aspen logs and in advanced decay stages had approximately 9% higher fungal species richness and 10% higher fungal diversity than small and large logs at medium decay stages. The effect of log diameter was in turn strongly dependent on the silvicultural treatment. In burned stands, larger logs supported higher fungal richness and diversity, therefore potentially acting as fungal refuge. A negative relationship between the fungal diversity of logs and snags and the volume of fine woody debris was also related to silvicultural treatments, as fine woody debris increased with silvicultural intensity. Our results underline the negative effects of intense silvicultural practice on fungal diversity and species richness by modifying community composition, but they also highlight the benefits of partial harvest, which retain coarse woody debris volume.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112712003052,Article,2012

With the development of these markers, there is an interest in determining levels of variation in natural populations. Here, we identify and characterize levels of SNPs in wild populations of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). Four populations were sampled from Alberta and British Columbia in Western Canada. A total of 35 gene regions were selected for analysis. The loci selected are mainly involved in wood formation and include regions from genes for lignin biosynthesis, cellulose biosynthesis, and other cell wall compounds and a number of transcription factors. Other genes included those coding for growth hormones, disease resistance, and light responses. Primers were developed from conserved regions in multi-species EST alignments. Regions were PCR amplified, and products (approximately 500 to 1,000 bp) were assessed for levels of SNPs using Ecotilling. From a total of approximately 25 kb 462 SNPs were identified, over 18 SNPs/kb. Thus, SNPs are an abundant and potentially useful molecular marker in aspen. Gene diversity (heterozygosity) varied in the gene regions, with an overall average of H T = 0.18. Although gene diversity was considerable, genetic differentiation was low with the overall F ST value being 0.004. A surrogate measure of linkage disequilibrium (LD) was calculated, and overall, the LD was shown to decay relatively rapidly with distance along the gene region. The results obtained from the wood formation genes in this study will enable further targeting of regions for association studies on lignin and cellulose variation in aspen and other Populus species.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11295-012-0467-x,Article,2012

We studied seed quantity and quality in intraspecific and interspecific crosses of the European and hybrid aspens over a two year period. In order to study whether elevated temperatures due to climate change would benefit the species differently, we performed the crosses in different temperatures. In both years, interspecific crosses produced more seeds with higher quality than intraspecific crosses. This result was most distinct in crosses between female hybrid aspen and male European aspen. In higher temperatures, relative germination difference between hybrid aspen seeds and seeds from P. tremula P. tremula crosses seems to increase. These results suggest that hybrid aspen may have a significant genetic impact on the European aspen, and this effect may be strengthened by climate warming.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8732&context=aspen_bib,Article,2012

In an effort to rejuvenate declining aspen stands, the Bureau of Land Management conducted conifer removal in three sites (2004 to 2006) and prescribed fire in two sites (2007). The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of these treatments. In each site, aspen densities in three regeneration size classes were measured in treated and untreated transects before and up to five years post-treatment. Five years after treatment, two of the three conifer removal sites showed significant improvement over controls in the density of total stems and two of three regeneration size classes. The third site did not show significant gains over controls in any size class and experienced significant aspen overstory mortality three years after treatment, which was attributed to sunscald and advanced age at the time of treatment. Three years after treatment, the two prescribed fire sites showed significant increases in total stem density and two regeneration size classes, but also exhibited significant stem mortality, which was likely due to a combination of herbivory and drought. Overall, both treatments can be effective, but future treatments should incorporate methods to reduce post-treatment mortality of residual aspen and new sprouts.",http://fireecology.org/journal/abstract/?abstract=177,Article,2012

A retrospective survey of windthrow was conducted in dispersed and group retention cuts conducted two to five years previously. In the Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec, the level of windthrow was comparable between group and dispersed tree retention. In the North Shore region of eastern Quebec, windthrow was higher in dispersed retention and levels of mortality were generally lower than in the Abitibi region. Windthrow probability was best explained by edaphic variables, tree species, slenderness ratio, tree height or diameter at breast height, and sapling abundance. Variables such as regional mean wind speed, retained group area, simple fetch and topographical exposure (Topex to distance) were not included in the best models.

This view has strongly influenced silvicultural treatment of western aspen and has led to low expectations concerning genetic diversity of stands and landscapes. However, recent discoveries are fundamentally altering our understanding of western aspen regeneration ecology and genetics. For example, there are clearly multiple pathways of aspen regeneration and stand development. Research on a variety of fronts indicates that seedling establishment is common enough to be ecologically important and that genetic diversity is substantially greater than previously thought. We review conventional understanding of western aspen and put this into the context of silvicultural practice.

Much attention to declining populations has focused on how changing climate drives phenological mismatches between animals and their food4, 5, 6. Effects of climate on plant communities may provide an alternative, but particularly powerful, influence on animal populations because plants provide their habitats. Here, we show that abundances of deciduous trees and associated songbirds have declined with decreasing snowfall over 22 years of study in montane Arizona, USA. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that declining snowfall indirectly influences plants and associated birds by allowing greater over-winter herbivory by elk (Cervus canadensis). We excluded elk from one of two paired snowmelt drainages (10  ha per drainage), and replicated this paired experiment across three distant canyons. Over six years, we reversed multi-decade declines in plant and bird populations by experimentally inhibiting heavy winter herbivory associated with declining snowfall. Moreover, predation rates on songbird nests decreased in exclosures, despite higher abundances of nest predators, demonstrating the over-riding importance of habitat quality to avian recruitment. Thus, our results suggest that climate impacts on plant–animal interactions can have forceful ramifying effects on plants, birds, and ecological interactions.",http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n3/full/nclimate1348.html,Article,2012

We field-measured ten metrics of aspen stand condition in 29 aspen stands. Along a gradient of increasing current conifer cover, we observed decreases in herbaceous species diversity and richness and an increase in forest floor O horizon depth. We interpreted aerial photos from 1952 and 1998 to determine whether directional changes in conifer cover had occurred in the stands over the past half century, and used regression modeling to associate succession with the observed range of aspen stand condition. From the period 1952 to 1998, we found that conifer encroachment occurred in half the sampled stands, with an average increase in conifer cover of 1 % a year. Aspen were persistent in the remaining stands. Stand cover dynamics and percent total canopy cover interacted to influence species richness, diversity, aspen sprouting, and litter quality. In stands with conifer encroachment, both understory species richness and diversity declined.

The genetic similarity rule (GSR) identifies 3 variables (host genetic composition, phytochemistry, and the environment) that could affect community composition. Few studies have determined the relative influence of these variables on community composition. Using path analysis, we found that arthropod community similarity was better explained by geographic (56%) and environmental (32%) distance than genetic distance in clonal aspen (Populus tremuloides). Comparing our data with data from similar studies of poplars (P. fremontii and P. fremontii × P. angustifolia hybrids), we found that hybrid poplar stands had higher levels of genetic and arthropod diversity than did clonal aspen stands. We found a significant relationship between genetic and arthropod diversity only in hybrid stands and across Populus systems. Our findings agree with the GSR expectations that the importance of the genetic composition of the host in structuring communities depends in part on the amount of genetic variation present in the study system. This is relevant for management and restoration strategies of geographically restricted species and of disjunct populations of otherwise widespread species, as these tend to have lower effective population sizes and reduced levels of genetic diversity.",http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2980/19-1-3402,Article,2012

Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forests have received a large amount of popular and academic attention over the last decade due to concerns over decline.  As a result, both private and public forest resource managers have focused attention on actively restoring aspen communities through treatments such as prescribed burning, logging, and grazing exclosures to name a few.  There is increasing evidence suggesting the existence of ""stable"" aspen communities.  This community type undergoes processes entirely different from successional aspen communities and therefore may require entirely different restoration treatments.  Classifying ""stable"" aspen communities has traditionally been done in the field according to community composition.  However, there is evidence that suggests ""stable"" aspen communities may be related to biophysical variables that can be attained through remote sensing and GIS methods.  This suggests the potential for a habitat modeling approach to classify ""stable"" and ""seral"" aspen communities, providing an extremely useful tool for planning aspen restoration projects across landscape scales.

Maximum R2values at age 14–19 ranged from 13.4% to 69.8%, demonstrating that the importance of aspen competition varied widely across a relatively small geographic range.

To investigate the status of this cascade, in September of 2010 we repeated an earlier survey of aspen and measured browsing and heights of young aspen in 97 stands along four streams in the Lamar River catchment of the park’s northern winter range. We found that browsing on the five tallest young aspen in each stand decreased from 100% of all measured leaders in 1998 to means of <25% in the uplands and <20% in riparian areas by 2010. Correspondingly, aspen recruitment (i.e., growth of seedlings/sprouts above the browse level of ungulates) increased as browsing decreased over time in these same stands. We repeated earlier inventories of cottonwoods and found that recruitment had also increased in recent years. We also synthesized studies on trophic cascades published during the first 15 years after wolf reintroduction. Synthesis results generally indicate that the reintroduction of wolves restored a trophic cascade with woody browse species growing taller and canopy cover increasing in some, but not all places. After wolf reintroduction, elk populations decreased, but both beaver (Caster canadensis) and bison (Bison bison) numbers increased, possibly due to the increase in available woody plants and herbaceous forage resulting from less competition with elk. Trophic cascades research during the first 15 years after wolf reintroduction indicated substantial initial effects on both plants and animals, but northern Yellowstone still appears to be in the early stages of ecosystem recovery. In ecosystems where wolves have been displaced or locally extirpated, their reintroduction may represent a particularly effective approach for passive restoration.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711004046,Article,2012

To address these issues, we established a common garden consisting of twelve genotypes of potted aspen (Populus tremuloides) trees, and subjected half of the trees to defoliation in two successive years. At the beginning of the third year, all trees were severed at the soil surface (coppiced) and allowed to regenerate for five months. Afterwards, we counted the number of root and stump sprouts produced and measured the basal diameter (d) and height (h) of the tallest ramet in each pot. We collected leaves one and two years after the second defoliation and assessed levels of phenolic glycosides, condensed tannins, and nitrogen. In terms of re-growth, we found that the total number of sprouts produced varied by 3.6-fold among genotypes, and that prior defoliation decreased total sprout production by 24%. The size (d2h) of ramets, however, did not differ significantly among genotypes or defoliation classes. In terms of phytochemistry, we observed genotypic differences in concentrations of all phytochemicals assessed both one and two years after the second defoliation. Two years after defoliation, we observed effects of prior defoliation in a genotype-by-defoliation interaction for condensed tannins. Results from this study demonstrate that genotypic differences and impacts of prior defoliation persist to influence growth and defense traits in trees even after complete removal of above-ground stems, and thus likely influence productivity and plant-herbivore interactions in forests affected by natural disturbances or actively managed through coppicing.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-012-0081-2,Article,2012

A deer exclosure experiment was initiated in 1991 in an old-growth northern mixed mesic forest in northeastern Minnesota, and resampled in 2008 to examine changes in composition, structure and productivity. Decades of overbrowsing by white-tailed deer have led to almost complete recruitment failure in size classes >2.5 cm dbh for preferred deer browse species Thuja occidentalis and Pinus strobus in unprotected plots. Other palatable browse species have been severely limited in understory development (Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Fraxinus nigra). Within exclosures, P. strobus gained in all size classes <20 cm dbh, while F. nigra, B. papyrifera, T. occidentalis all showed significant gains. Non-preferred Picea glauca increased outside exclosures, but has also gained within exclosures. The increase in P. glauca across treatments indicates a long-term legacy effect of preferential browsing. Browsing induced suppression of subcanopy density of preferred species and failure of canopy tree replacement may lead to a more open woodland structure dominated by P. glauca. Browsing pressure may negatively impact productivity, as whole tree biomass in exclosures increased at a rate twice that of unprotected plots. The low biomass levels recorded in 2008 (unprotected: 98.0 mg/haÿ1 , exclosure: 104 mg/haÿ1 ) are approximately 1/2 of values typically recorded in later successional forests in this region indicating lower productivity may be another longer-term legacy of elevated deer population. Continued high browsing pressure is one of many factors contributing to the restructuring of northern Great Lakes forests away from historical variability conditions towards a novel and more homogeneous forested landscape. These simplified forests may be less resilient to the suite of emerging stressors such as climate change and less able to provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage, biological diversity and forest products. Sustained restoration efforts, along with reductions in deer density will be needed to restore species and structural diversity.",http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/minnesota/long-term-effects-of-deer-browsing-on-minnesotas-forests.pdf,Article,2012

In field manipulation experiments, we assessed the effects of varying moss and snow depths on the physiology of black spruce (Picea ­mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) in the boreal black spruce forest of western Québec. For 1 year, naturally regenerated 10-year-old spruce and aspen were grown with one of the following treatments: additional N fertilization, addition of sphagnum moss cover, removal of mosses, delayed soil thawing through snow and hay addition, or accelerated soil thawing through springtime snow removal. Treatments that involved the addition of insulating moss or snow in the spring caused lower soil temperature, while removing moss and snow in the spring caused elevated soil temperature and thus had a warming effect. Soil warming treatments were associated with greater temperature variability. Additional soil cover, whether moss or snow, increased the rate of photosynthetic recovery in the spring. Moss and snow removal, on the other hand, had the opposite effect and lowered photosynthetic activity, especially in spruce. Maximal electron transport rate (ETRmax) was, for spruce, 39.5% lower after moss removal than with moss addition, and 16.3% lower with accelerated thawing than with delayed thawing. Impaired photosynthetic recovery in the absence of insulating moss or snow covers was associated with lower foliar N concentrations. Both species were affected in that way, but trembling aspen generally reacted less strongly to all treatments. Our results indicate that a clear negative response of black spruce to changes in root-zone temperature should be anticipated in a future climate. Reduced moss cover and snow depth could adversely affect the photosynthetic capacities of black spruce, while having only minor effects on trembling aspen.",http://treephys.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/11/1204.abstract,Article,2011

However, the responses of saproxylic communities to variations in dead wood characteristics remains poorly documented, a lack of knowledge that may impede the development of efficient management strategies. We established the relationship between saproxylic beetles—at the species and community levels—and attributes of black spruce and balsam fir in old-growth boreal forests. The relationship was first evaluated for individual snag bole segments, and then for forest stands. A total of 168 bole sections were collected in summer 2006 along a compositional gradient ranging from black spruce-dominated stands to balsam fir-dominated ones, in a boreal forest dominated by >90-year-old stands. A total of 16,804 beetles belonging to 47 species emerged from bole segments, with 21% of the species being found exclusively in black spruce snags and 36% exclusively in balsam fir snags. Black spruce and balsam fir snags thus contributed differently to forest biodiversity by being inhabited by different saproxylic communities. Wood density was an important attribute in the host-use patterns for several species of saproxylic beetles, but no relationship was found between snag availability within stands and abundance of beetles strongly linked to either black spruce or balsam fir.

Patterns of aspen mortality and recruitment may reflect local conditions, or may show broad synchrony if regional-scale drivers are important. This paper aggregates historical aspen establishment data from 12 case studies from nine locations in a meta-analysis of emergent patterns of aspen dynamics at sub-continental or mesoscales (104–106 km2). Aspen establishment data were reported in multiple forms among studies, so the meta-analysis included two approaches (1) a quantitative analysis of percent aspen establishment in decadal time bins for 1820–1999 for six studies that reported data in a format suited for this approach and (2) a qualitative ranking of 19th and 20th century peaks in aspen establishment for all 12 studies. Aspen forests ranging from Wyoming to northern Arizona experienced two peaks in establishment between 1820 and the 1980s. The first peak began in the 1860s, reached its maximum in the 1880s, and gradually declined to an end the 1910s. The second peak began abruptly in the 1970s and continued through the 1980s. I speculate that the late-1800s peak in aspen recruitment was driven primarily by the occurrence of the last historical fires throughout the intermountain West and that the 1970s and 1980s peak was driven by improved moisture conditions brought about by a shift to a positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and a persistent negative phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The overarching implication of large-scale synchrony in aspen dynamics is that current aspen ecosystem condition is not solely the result of local-scale histories of browsing or fire, but is more likely the interwoven legacy of these local factors combined with broad factors such as climate and Euro-American settlement.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112711002180,Article,2011

Density of stems > 2 m declined 12 percent from 1991 to 2006 (P = 0.04), which indicates that recruitment stems are not being produced at a sufficient rate to replace aging overstories. Areas with the greatest elk densities had the lowest recruitment stem densities and contributed the most to the decline.

We hypothesized that different forest types (black spruce, trembling aspen, and mixedwood) found on a similar site type differentially affect soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution among physical fractions. The surface mineral soil (0–15 cm) of 24 plots differing in forest composition was sampled in forested Hapludalfs of the Abitibi-James Bay region, Canada. The soil was first separated into three water-stable aggregate size fractions (>1000, 1000–250, and <250 μm) by wet sieving, followed by a density flotation (NaI: 1.7 g cm−3) and a dispersion (with glass beads) to isolate the free light fraction (LF), the intraaggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) and the silt plus clay fraction (S&C). According to mixed linear models, whole SOC contents (in Mg C ha−1) decreased in the following order: black spruce (46.3) > mixedwood (41.9) > trembling aspen (34.7). While similar amounts of SOC (~30 Mg C ha−1) were found in the S&C, more SOC was found in the less protected fractions (i.e., uncomplexed organic matter, UOM: LF and iPOM) under black spruce than under trembling aspen, the mixedwood being intermediate. This higher accumulation of UOM under black spruce suggests a slower C turnover that is probably induced by the low-quality C inputs and environmental constraints to decomposition found in these forests. These differences in the amounts of SOC stored within soil physical fractions might have strong repercussions on the SOC budget of the boreal forest of eastern Canada under climate change.",https://www.soils.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/75/3/1125,Article,2011

The objective ofthis study is to evaluate how the density and size of aspen patches influence the change in density, size and persistence ofpatches following clearcutting of black spruce forests in the claybelt region of northwestern Quebec. To do this, we finelyinterpreted: 1) aerial photos taken between 1970 and 1979 of 12 mature black spruce-dominated stands containing varyingsizes and densities of aspen patches prior to being clearcut harvested and 2) aerial photos taken between 1992 and1995 of the 12 resulting clearcuts, 11 to 18 years after harvesting. Sketch maps of pre- and post-harvest aspen presencewere rasterized and changes in aspen patch size and cover were determined. As well, the probabilities of aspen colonizationwith increasing distance from pre-harvest patches were calculated for each site. Black spruce forests of the claybeltcontaining no aspen prior to harvesting are relatively resistant to aspen invasion. However, when forests do contain aspenpatches with cover values ≤25%, almost 60% of these patches increase to a higher density class. Aspen patches less than 2ha in area had about a 50% probability of disappearing following clearcutting whereas larger patches had about a 96%chance of persisting as a result of clearcutting. In the black spruce forest of the claybelt, thick organic layers appear to havea negative effect on aspen recruitment.

In this study, the growth and quality of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) regeneration were examined 5–7 years after spraying with glyphosate herbicide before and after harvesting. Results were compared to those from a partial cut and clearcut treatment without herbicide treatments. The preharvest spray treatment effectively reduced aspen density and height but did not lower regeneration quality—assessed by stem and crown deformation and stem stain—compared to the postharvest spray and clearcut treatments. Increased stem stain in the postharvest spray treatment was largely associated with the stem section that grew prior to herbicide application—post-herbicide growth was not affected. While the effect of stem stain may be restricted to growth that occurred before herbicide use, stem deformation from stem dieback may have longer term effects. In the partial cut treatments both density and stocking of aspen regeneration were lower, but aspen basal diameter growth, height growth, and quality were similar to those in the clearcut treatment. Thus, preharvest spray should promote conifer growth by reducing the density and growth of aspen regeneration without reducing the quality of aspen; this should be considered a preferred treatment to support for management objectives calling for productive and healthy mixtures of fast-growing aspen and slow-growing conifers.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112711003938,Article,2011

This may be particularly common with indirect defenses, such as extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), that attract predatory arthropods and are dependent on predator distribution, abundance, and behavior. We tested the defensive effects of EFNs in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) against damage by a specialist herbivore, the aspen leaf miner (Phyllocnistis populiella Cham.), at the scale of individual leaves and entire ramets (i.e., stems). Experiments excluding crawling arthropods revealed that the effects of aspen EFNs differed at the leaf and ramet scales. Crawling predators caused similar reductions in the percent leaf area mined on individual leaves with and without EFNs. However, the extent to which crawling predators increased leaf miner mortality and, consequently, reduced mining damage increased with EFN expression at the ramet scale. Thus, aspen EFNs provided a diffuse defense, reducing damage to leaves across a ramet regardless of leaf-scale EFN expression. We detected lower leaf miner damage and survival unassociated with crawling predators on EFN-bearing leaves, suggesting that direct defenses (e.g., chemical defenses) were stronger on leaves with than without EFNs. Greater direct defenses on EFN-bearing leaves may reduce the probability of losing these leaves and thus weakening ramet-scale EFN defense. Aspengrowth was not related to EFN expression or the presence of crawling predators over the course of a single season. Different effects of aspen EFNs at the leaf and ramet scales suggest that future studies may benefit from examining indirect defenses simultaneously at multiple scales.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00442-010-1799-6,Article,2011

Lewis's Woodpecker selected nest trees that were larger in diameter than random trees and selected nest sites with more trees, fewer woody stems, and less bare ground than random sites. However, nest-site characteristics were not important determinants of nest survival. Rather, nest-initiation date and daily maximum temperature had the strongest influence on nest survival, which was higher for early nesters and increased with increasing daily maximum temperature.

The loss of aspen from western landscapes will continue to profoundly impact biological, commercial, and aesthetic resources associated with aspen. However, many options are available for its restoration. Advances in remote sensing technologies offer cost-effective means to produce spatial and quantitative information on the distribution and severity of declining aspen at many scales. This report describes the development and application of transferable remote sensing and geographic information system methodologies to accurately classify aspen condition within areas of delineated aspen woodland cover. These methodologies were applied on Cedar Mountain in southern Utah within the Colorado Plateau to map three aspen stand conditions (healthy, damaged, and seral) successfully. Using moderate-scale imagery (2008 Landsat TM data), digital elevation model derivatives, high-resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery, and a decision tree modeling approach, a spatially explicit 2008 landscape assessment of Cedar Mountain aspen was produced with an overall accuracy of 81.3% (Kappa [к] or KHAT accuracy measure = 0.69, n = 445). Of the total area mapped as aspen within the 12,139-ha study area, healthy aspen was the most abundant with 49% (5960 ha), followed by damaged with 35% (4210 ha), and seral with an estimated 16% (1968 ha) coverage. Aspen classification maps, derived from remotely sensed digital imagery and ancillary datasets, can offer objective management information to land managers to utilize when planning, implementing, and evaluating aspen restoration activities.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8056&context=aspen_bib,Report,2011

It therefore seems likely that commensurate shifts in dependent epiphytes would follow major ecological transitions. In the current study, we merge several lines of inquiry to investigate historical changes using lichens as bioindicators of forest structure, air quality, and community composition. Though lichens are well known for their sensitivity to air borne pollutants, recent utilization in the monitoring realm has lead to novel uses as indicators of biodiversity and stand composition. A landscape- level investigation in northern Utah and southern Idaho, USA, was implemented to track contemporary and long-term impacts of humans on aspen forests and their dependent macrolichens. We use historical sources, climate data, fire records, and passive ammonia sensors alongside forest and lichen monitoring techniques to gain further insight into aspen and epiphytic lichen community change over the past 150 years. Our research shows that historic drought conditions correlated closely with pulses of aspen regeneration during this period. Aspen initiation was closely aligned with large-scale resource impacts of the late 19th century. During the 20th century a moist climate pattern generally favored shade-tolerant conifers. Additionally, results from nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination indicate a primary successional gradient in determining lichen communities, but also revealed a significant gradient of more recent impacts from nitrogen loading originating from local ammonia (NH3) sources. While advancing succession generally favors lichen diversity, our findings suggest that medium-distance transport (10-50 km) of local air pollutants is already contributing to altered lichen communities. Overall, there are strong ties between landscape-level disturbance history and present aspen-dependent species assemblages. Effects on the epiphytic community are viewed as symptomatic of greater biodiversity and ecosystem impacts.",https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=30532,Contribution to Book,2011

We conducted a field survey and a manipulative field study to test the productivity–diversity hypothesis, which predicts that mixed-wood stands are more likely to occur on fertile soils, or following fertilization. We surveyed 44 mixed-wood stands and found 43 of these occurring on fertile clay deposits, and only one occurring on a nutrient poor till deposit. By contrast, the area surveyed comprised 45% clay and 55% till deposits. In a second study, we conducted a five year fertilization and brushing trial in a recently burned area dominated by jack pine saplings with patches of regenerating trembling aspen. Fertilization without brushing improved the growth and recruitment of aspen stems, but had no effect on jack pine growth and recruitment. Fertilization + brushing increased the growth of jack pine. Brushing the aspen, with or without fertilization, resulted in higher recruitment of jack pine. We conclude that soil fertility controls the mixing of jack pine with trembling aspen, that fertilization increases the likelihood of encroachment of aspen into areas formerly dominated by jack pine, and that brushing along with fertilization is necessary to promote jack pine growth.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112711003495,Article,2011

Because elk (Cervus elaphus) select habitats at different scales from home ranges to microsites, it is important for managers to know how elk utilize vegetative conditions within these stands. We compared vegetative conditions at microsites selected by elk to the vegetative conditions of similarly classified stands to enable managers to better understand how timber management affects elk habitat. Within these relatively homogeneous forest stands under even-age management of the Black Hills, elk demonstrated selection for particular forest attributes.

Availability of habitat elements typical of these stand types, such as standing dead wood, decreases, and dependant species may have their abundance reduced or become locally extirpated, potentially affecting the ecosystem processes/services in which they take part. We evaluated the impact of habitat loss on saprophagous wood-boring beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in an aspen-dominated landscape intensively logged for the past 30 years. Sixty natural snags of middle decay class were chosen along a gradient of habitat loss and disturbance age, cut down and dissected for beetle larvae. We then assessed relationships between species occurrence and percentage of residual cover and age of disturbance at spatial scales ranging from 40 to 2000 m radii. The most common species, Anthophylax attenuatus, showed no response, being abundant regardless of the intensity of habitat loss. The second most common species, Bellamira scalaris, showed a negative response, especially in sites which had been fragmented for a longer time. A third species, Trachysida mutabilis, showed an inverse trend, having a higher probability of presence where habitat loss was more severe. Our study shows that some saprophagous wood-borers do react negatively to habitat loss, but that within a relatively homogenous group the response can vary significantly between species. Saprophagous wood-borers should be considered potentially sensitive to habitat loss, and their response to fragmentation remains to be evaluated on a longer time frame.",http://www.springerlink.com/content/ln6k8565447vqj72/,Article,2011

The primary objective of this study was to examine how increasing conifer dominance affects aspen regeneration vigor following the return of fire. The influence of physiographic features and herbivory on aspen regeneration vigor were also examined. The study was conducted in the Sanford fire complex located in the Dixie National Forest in southern Utah, USA, where more than 31,000 hectares burned in the summer of 2002. Seven years after the burn (at 66 locations) we measured aspen regeneration density and height as response variables and former stand composition and density (the burned trees were still standing), soil characteristics, slope, aspect and presence or absence of herbivory as independent variables. Aspen regeneration (root suckering) densities ranged from <500 to 228,000 stems/hectare with an average of 37,000 stems/hectare. Post-fire aspen regeneration density was most strongly correlated with pre-fire stand successional status (as measured by stand composition and species abundance), with percent conifer abundance (R2 = −0.55) and overstory aspen density (R2 = + 0.50) being the most important. Average aspen suckering densities ranged from approximately 60,000 stems/hectare in what were relatively pure aspen stands (>90% aspen) to less than 5000 stems/hectare in stands where conifer abundance was greater than 90%. Soil C, N, and P showed positive correlations (R2 = 0.07 to 0.17) with aspen regeneration vigor, while soil texture had a relatively weak influence on sucker regeneration. Aspen regeneration densities were 15% lower on north facing aspects compared to east, west and south facing aspects with slope steepness showing no correlation with regeneration vigor. Regeneration density was significantly lower (8%) at sites with evidence of herbivory versus sites where herbivory was absent. Overall, the aspen regeneration response in the Sanford fire complex was strong despite high wildlife densities, which may be related to disturbance size. Where the maintenance of aspen is desired in the landscape we recommend promoting fire when the percentage of overstory conifer stems is greater than 80% or overstory aspen density is less than 200 overstory stems/hectare.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112711001812,Article,2011

To explore some of the mechanisms that influence quality of the breeding habitat, we measured demographic and breeding resources in four forest stands each of 95-year-old quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and 182-year-old sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, from 2007 to 2009. Population density was higher, egg laying earlier, clutches larger, hatching success greater, and per capita and population fledgling production higher in maple stands compared with aspen stands. Longer nest-building and prelaying stages in aspen stands delayed egg laying by 5 days relative to maple stands. The delay in egg laying in aspen stands may have been caused by lower quality sap resources, which then resulted in lower productivity. Adults delivered smaller food loads to nests in aspen stands than in maple stands, which may have increased nestling mortality in aspen stands. Although per capita fledgling production was lower in aspen stands than in maple stands, Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers in both forests were able to replace themselves, suggesting that mature deciduous and mixed-deciduous forests, in general, are high-quality breeding habitat for this sapsucker.

La durée plus longue des étapes de la construction du nid et d'avant la ponte dans les peuplements de peupliers retarde la ponte de 5 jours par rapport aux peuplements d'érables. Ce délai de la ponte dans les peuplements de peupliers peut être dû aux ressources de sève de moins bonne qualité, ce qui mène à une productivité réduite.

Growth among families varied significantly, and the interaction between family and soil type was significant. From 2–5 months, leaf number correlated with that of the first month and salin-ity tolerance. Sodium ions varied significantly within plants and among families; seedlings that accumulated higher Na+ concentrations in root had more leaves and lower Na+ in shoot. These results suggest that leaf number indicates salt tolerance in young seedlings. Seedling performance was also affected by soil type, especially the root/shoot ratio, suggesting an interaction between salt tolerance and growth medium.

These historical plots were located as accurately as possible and resampled in 2004 to document multi-decadal changes in never-harvested Southwestern forests. Findings for ponderosa pine forest (PPF) differed among three forest subtypes (dry, mesic, and moist PPF), indicating that understanding the ecology of PPF subtypes is essential for development of ecologically based management practices. Dry PPF, which is transitional with pinyon-juniper vegetation at low elevation, exhibited no changes from 1935 to 2004. Mesic PPF, the core subtype of PPF, had increased densities of total trees, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and white fir (Abies concolor) in the 10–29.9 cm diameter class from 1935 to 2004 that may have induced decreased densities of larger ponderosa pines and total tree and ponderosa pine basal areas. Moist PPF, which is transitional with mixed conifer forest at high elevation, was the most dynamic PPF subtype with decreases from 1935 to 2004 in total density and total basal area that are largely attributable to decreases in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). Graphical synthesis of datasets with historical and modern values for density and basal area indicates that overall PPF (all subtypes combined) increased in sapling density of all species combined and conifers with canopy potential and decreased in density of quaking aspen trees since the late 19th century. PPF of GCNP has passed through an accretion phase of forest development with increases in density and, depending on PPF subtype and variable being examined, is at or past the point of inflection to recession of density and basal area. Increases in small diameter ponderosa pine and white fir from 1935 to 2004 portend potential additional accretion, but decreases in total basal area, density and basal area of quaking aspen, basal area of ponderosa pine, and density of larger diameter ponderosa pine indicate PPF has passed the inflection point from accretion to recession. Uncertainties about 19th-century PPF structure and composition and about future ecological and societal environments lead to the conclusion that resource managers of GCNP and other natural areas should consider a change in focus from the objective of achieving desired future conditions to an objective of avoiding undesired future conditions.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112710002951,Article,2011

The 1935 plots are the earliest-known, sample-intensive, quantitative documentation of forest vegetation over a Southwest USA landscape. Findings documented that previously described increases in densities and basal areas attributed to fire exclusion were followed by decreases in 1935–2004 and 1984–2005. Decreases in MCF were attributable primarily to quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and white fir (Abies concolor), but there were differences between dry-mesic and moist-mesic MCF subtypes. Decreases in SFF were attributable to quaking aspen, spruce (Picea engelmannii + Picea pungens), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Decreases in QAF resulted from the loss of quaking aspen during succession. Changes in ponderosa pine forest (PPF) are described in a parallel paper (Vankat, J.L., 2011. Post-1935 changes in forest vegetation of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA: part 1 – ponderosa pine forest. Forest Ecology and Management 261, 309–325). Graphical synthesis of historical and modern MCF data sets for GCNP indicated tree densities and basal areas increased from the late 19th to the mid 20th century and then decreased to the 21st century. Changes began earlier, occurred more rapidly, and/or were larger at higher elevation. Plot data showed that basal area decreased earlier and/or more rapidly than density and that decreases from 1935 to 2004 resulted in convergence among MCF, SFF, and PPF. If GCNP coniferous forests are trending toward conditions present before fire exclusion, this implies density and basal area were more similar among these forests in the late 19th century than in 1935. Changes in MCF and SFF can be placed in a general framework of forest accretion, inflection, and recession in which increases in tree density and basal area are followed by an inflection point and decreases. Accretion was triggered by the exogenous factor of fire exclusion, and inflection and recession apparently were driven by the endogenous factor of density-dependent mortality combined with exogenous factors such as climate. Although the decreases in density and basal area could be unique to GCNP, it is likely that the historical study plots provided a unique opportunity to quantitatively determine forest trends since 1935. This documentation of post-1935 decreases in MCF and SFF densities and basal areas indicates a shift in perspective on Southwestern forests is needed.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112710005475,Article,2011

Organic matter removal treatments included main bole, total tree harvest, and total tree harvest with forest floor removal. Compaction treatments included  no compaction beyond normal levels from harvest, moderate compaction, and heavy compaction. Main bole harvest with no additional compaction served as the control against which other treatments were compared. Study treatments were replicated in three locations on a clay loam, silt loam, and loamy sand  soil. All compaction treatments on all three soil types increased bulk density above preharvest levels. In most cases, bulk density at year 10 had decreased significantly compared to year 0, but was still generally above preharvest levels. Total carbon and nitrogen showed no impact from treatment at year 10. In general, soil cations were little affected by organic matter removal. The major exceptions were lower near-surface calcium in the loamy sand soil with total  tree harvest plus forest floor removal, and lower potassium at 10-20 cm depth  in the loam soil for both total tree harvest with and without forest floor removal. Compaction and organic matter removal treatments impacted aboveground forest productivity, however the effects were not universal across the soil types. Aboveground biomass production declined on the loam soil with moderate and heavy compaction. Production increased with moderate compaction on the loamy sand and clay loam soils, but significantly decreased with heavy compaction on the clay loam soil. Total tree harvest with forest floor removal reduced production on the loamy sand and loam soils, while it increased production on the clay loam soil. Results from this study suggest that heavy compaction and/or high organic matter removals (e.g., total tree harvest plus forest floor removal) are generally detrimental to sustaining forest productivity across soil types. Total tree harvest with limited compaction may be sustainable, at least as reflected in 10 year results, after one harvest entry. Managers should be cautious of approaches involving whole-tree harvests, or even bole-only harvests, on short rotations  (~10 years), as such approaches will limit the potential for recovery to preharvest bulk densities and may have the potential to increase compaction to levels seen with heavy compaction.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8057&context=aspen_bib,Document,2011

The significant damaging agents in relation to both overstory crown dieback and mortality were canker diseases (R2 = 0.13, P = 0.0123; R2 = 0.18, P = 0.0028, respectively) and wood-boring insects (R2 = 0.24, P = 0.0005; R2 = 0.56, P < 0.0001, respectively). Sapling and tall sucker aspen mortality were high (> 80 and 70%, respectively), while short sucker mortality was low (16%). Many sites did not have live aspen regeneration, therefore, sample sizes were low, and relationships were often inconclusive or weak. Animal damages and canker diseases were common in the sapling and tall sucker size classes. Only animal damages were common in the short sucker size class. Among damaging agents and regeneration size classes, the only significant univariate relationship found was between animal damages and short sucker aspen mortality (R2 = 0.15, P = 0.0198). Based on a negative exponential diameter distribution, there was lack of aspen recruitment in saplings and small diameter overstory stems. If high mortality and low recruitment continues, aspen stands will be replaced by conifer after larger, and presumably older, overstory aspen stems die. The multivariate relationships of overstory aspen crown dieback, overstory aspen mortality, and short sucker aspen mortality among site, stand, and damaging agent factors were explored using step-wise multiple regression. The significant multivariate associations with overstory aspen crown dieback were elevation (F1,44 = 16.38, P = 0.0002) and incidence of canker diseases (F1,44 = 15.02, P = 0.0004). The significant factors explaining the variation in overstory aspen mortality were forest type (F1,43 = 5.92, P = 0.0192), overstory percent conifer (F1,43 = 8.24, P = 0.0063), and incidence of canker diseases (F1,43 = 33.05, P < 0.0001), and wood-boring insects (F1,43 = 33.29, P < 0.0001). The significant factors explaining the variation in short sucker aspen mortality were slope (F1,31 = 4.90, P = 0.0344), short sucker percent conifer (F1,31 = 5.00, P = 0.0327), and incidence of animal damages (F1,31 = 6.85, P = 0.0136). According to previous research, ungulate herbivores contribute to aspen decline in northern Arizona by causing damage to aspen regeneration. Ungulate damages were common in all size classes (between 49 and 66%), but significant relationships were limited to short sucker aspen mortality. No data were collected from within ungulate exclosures in this study. Controlled experiments inside and outside of ungulate exclosures are needed to determine the impact of ungulates.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8105&context=aspen_bib,Thesis/Dissertation,2011

Two approaches to limiting these losses include cultivation of poplar varieties with inherent resistance to pests and application of microbial pesticides. Little is known about the interaction between host resistance and the ability of poplars to support the efficacy of biocontrol agents. The research described here was conducted to survey the effect of hybrid poplar clones on gypsy moth,Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), a pest on these trees. We assessed the effect of various poplar clones on larval performance and susceptibility to Bacillus thuringiensissubsp, kurstaki. Larvae were reared from hatching on the foliage of 25 hybrid poplar clones and we monitored larval survival, development time, and weight at fourth instar. Eight of these clones showed high resistance against gypsy moth. The remaining clones showed high variation in their effect on larval performance. We evaluated the susceptibility of third-instar larvae to B. thuringiensis subsp, kurstaki when reared on the 17 remaining clones. There was a significant effect of poplar clone on time to death after ingestion of B. thuringiensissubsp. kurstaki.

No carbon gain was found in species mixtures; nearly pure trembling aspen stands contained the greatest amount of aboveground carbon, black spruce stands had the least, and mixtures were intermediate with amounts that could generally be predicted by linear interpolation with stem proportions. These results suggest that for aspen, the potentially detrimental effect of spruce on soils observed in other studies may be offset by greater light availability in mixtures. On the other hand, for black spruce, the potentially beneficial effects of aspen on soils could be offset by greater competition by aspen for nutrients and light.

Location: Southern Utah, USA. Methods: One hundred and seven plots across a high- elevation P. engelmannii forest were sampled to re- construct pre-outbreak overstory and seedling bank densities, and calculate their associated metrics of diversity. Decade of establishment by seedling bank trees indicated ‘‘chronic’’ and ‘‘pulse’’ regenerators. Results: The post-outbreak overstory and seedling bank were dominated by A. lasiocarpa. Although Pinus flexilis, Pinus ponderosa, Picea pungens, and Psuedotsuga menziesii were present in the overstory, they were virtually absent in the seedling bank. Seedling bank recruitment of A. lasiocarpa and P. engelmannii has been occurring chronically for at least the last 205 and 152 years, respectively. A pulse response of seedling bank Populus tremuloides was apparent; however, results were complicated by intense ungulate browsing. Conclusions: Despite some similarities to the high-severity, infrequent/low-severity, frequent conceptualization of regeneration response to disturbance, the high-severity D. rufipennis outbreak is best described by explicitly considering host specificity and severity. Although, the outbreak simultaneously promoted both a pulse of P. tremuloides and a release of chronically regenerated A. lasiocarpa, the P. tremuloides response was generally masked by ungulate browsing, and the regeneration response came overwhelmingly from the A. lasiocarpa seedling bank. In this landscape, once dominated by P. engelmannii, the chronically regenerating seed- ling bank, typically thought to take advantage of canopy gaps associated with low-severity disturbances, is poised to dominate forest reorganization in response to the host-specific outbreak.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4482&context=aspen_bib,Article,2010

Unburned stands were surveyed to determine whether aspen regeneration was occurring following long term disruption of historical fire return intervals. This information was compared to stem response in nearby burned stands. Regeneration was noted in only one of 40 unburned stands, suggesting aspen stands were declining in this area. Three years after prescribed fire sucker density was significantly higher in the burned stands. This increased the likelihood that stands could regenerate. Based on earlier studies describing suppression of stand regeneration by cattle (Bos taurus) and elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) browsing impacts on aspen sucker height and density were measured in a sub-sample of burned stands. Within the first three years post-fire big game and the combination of big game and cattle did not affect sucker density in the burned stands. Although sucker height was significantly less in plots used by ungulates it may not be high enough to prevent regeneration. This assertion was supported by sufficient annual growth rates and the recruitment of individual regeneration stems into burned stands. Results from this study indicate that aspen stands can be successfully regenerated in areas where elk numbers are less than 1 animal/km2 and cattle grazing is closely managed.

Further, a site-specific recombination at the FRT sites leading to targeted integration of a fragment could be demonstrated for the FLP/FRT system.

We extracted increment cores from 10-12 aspen in each of 16 stands spread across a 1,526 km2 area. Using ring widths, we created a182-year standardized chronology from 1821 to 2003 A.D. composed of 151 series.

We found positive relationships between growth and springtime maximum snow depth, and negative relationships between growth and temperature and moisture stress (PDSI). Aspen were impacted by these factors from the previous growing season, suggesting a lag effect of climate. Variation in sensitivity to temperature and PDSI among our stands could not be explained by landscape variables, but sensitivity to the prior March maximum snow depth was greater at high elevations and on shallower slopes.

However, there are considerable local and regional differences in the intensity and duration of past forest utilization. We studied the impact of human forest use on the diversity of epiphytic and epixylic lichens in late-successional Pinus sylvestris-dominated forests by assessing species richness and composition along both local and regional gradients in forest utilization. The effects of local logging intensity were analysed by comparing three types of stands: (i) near-natural, (ii) selectively logged (in the early 20th century) and (iii) managed stands. The effects of regional differences in duration and intensity of past forest use were analysed by comparing stands in two contrasting regions (Häme and Kuhmo–Viena). The species richness of selectively logged stands was as high as that of near-natural stands and significantly higher in these two stand categories than in managed stands. Species richness increased with the density of small understorey Picea, which correlated strongly with decreasing intensity of local forest use and increasing structural complexity of selectively logged and near-natural stands. Stands in the Häme region hosted a lower number of species, and were less likely to host many old-growth indicator species than the Kuhmo–Viena region, suggesting that species have been lost from stands in the Häme region due to a longer history of intensive forest use. We conclude that selectively logged stands, along with near-natural stands, are valuable lichen habitats particularly for species confined to old-growth structures such as coarse trees and deadwood. In landscapes where natural forests have become fragmented, the management or restoration of the remaining late-successional Pinus-dominated forests, e.g. through the use of fire, should be carefully planned to avoid adverse effects on lichen species richness.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6X-4Y0K9P6-2&_user=464852&_coverDate=02/20/2010&_rdoc=5&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235042%232010%23997409994%231619096%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=5042&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=23&_acct=C000022310&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=464852&md5=f8ffe02f4b8f2d4305f6129fdf0e3d14&searchtype=a,Article,2010

Here, we subjected 4-month-old aspen seedlings grown in two contrasting soil media to a progressive drought until total leaf mortality, followed by a rewatering cycle. Stomatal conductance (gs), photosynthesis and transpiration followed a sigmoid decline with declining fraction of extractable soil water values. Cessation of leaf expansion occurred close to the end of the linear-decrease phase, when gs was reduced by 95%. Leaf mortality started after gs reached the lowest values, which corresponded to a stem–xylem pressure potential (Ψxp) of −2.0 MPa and a percent loss of stem hydraulic conductivity (PLC) of 50%. In plants with 50% leaf mortality, PLC values remained around 50%. Complete leaf mortality occurred at an average stem PLC of 90%, but all seedlings were able to resprout after 6–10 days of being rewatered. Plants decapitated at soil level before rewatering developed root suckers, while those left with a 4-cm stump or with their stems intact resprouted exclusively from axillary buds. Resprouting was accompanied by recovery of stem hydraulic conductivity, with PLC values around 30%. The percentage of resprouted buds was negatively correlated with the stem %PLC. Thus, the recovery of stem hydraulic conductivity appears as an important factor in the resprouting capacity of aspen seedlings following a severe drought.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2010.01397.x/full,Article,2010

The results suggest that poplar (aspen and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.)) mortality increased with consecutive years of insect defoliation occurring from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s and the proportion of poplars in the overstory, but decreased with improved pre-defoliation tree vigour (DBH increment). The first outbreak, which lasted from the mid-1980s to early 1990s, was more severe in terms of insect defoliation and contributed more to poplar mortality and decline. The decline began in the late 1990s and peaked in early 2000s. Poplar regeneration and understory shrubs responded rapidly to foliage loss to insect defoliation and mortality of overstory poplars. The regenerated poplars were able to maintain their growth under developing shrubs and residual overstory canopy and numbers were sufficient to compensate for the poplar trees lost to insect infestation. The defoliation-induced overstory decline will accelerate the transition of aspen stands to conifer dominance through enhanced conifer recruitment and growth, and reduced hardwood overstory in aspen-dominated stands, while hardwood dominance will persist in pure aspen stands. From a timber supply perspective, the decline caused by forest tent caterpillar defoliation could delay the availability of aspen stands for harvesting by 40–50 years.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6X-5119FTH-6&_user=464852&_coverDate=10/15/2010&_rdoc=24&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235042%232010%23997399989%232461761%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=5042&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=31&_acct=C000022310&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=464852&md5=2b2bdc171386d358150930b65137742e&searchtype=a,Article,2010

The long-term persistence of aspen in many regions in Scandinavia has been questioned due to the historically high browsing levels. We here review the basic ecology, genetics and life histories of aspen in a browsing context. Browsers can suppress the regeneration of aspen and the relatively short lifespan of the trees result in frequent regeneration cycles and concurrent exposure to browsers. In the long term, browsing may reduce recruitment and delay maturation, increase mortality and ultimately cause a decline of aspen. Norwegian forest inventory data indicate a reduced recruitment rate of young aspen (diameter at breast height; 60–79 mm) during the last 25 years, but it is unclear whether this is all due to browsing. Regeneration may also be hampered by lack of disturbance. Recent genetic studies have shown that aspen may have substantial regeneration by seeds, which allows for effective migration. The main conclusion of this review is that although browsing may affect demography and local abundance of aspen, it is very unlikely to lead to the eradication of the species in Fennoscandia.",http://forestry.oxfordjournals.org/content/84/1/61.full,Article,2010

The SOC decomposability in mineral soil samples (0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm) was derived from 10-mo lab incubations. The amount of SOC accumulated in the A horizon (16 Mg ha−1) and the top 1 m (74 Mg ha−1) of the mineral soil did not differ significantly among vegetation type, but upper forest soils tended to contain more decomposable SOC than rangeland soils. The CO2 efflux measured in the field varied significantly with vegetation cover (aspen > conifer = sagebrush > grass–forb), ranging from 12 kg CO2–C ha−1 d−1 in aspen to 5 kg CO2–C ha−1 d−1 in the grass–forb sites. It increased (?35%) immediately following water additions, with treatment effects dissipating within 1 wk.

The Cerro Grande Fire (CGF) of May 2000 burned 17,400 ha of elk transitory-use range in the Jemez Mountains, north-central New Mexico. Our objective was to determine if habitat use changed temporally following the fire and if graminoid cover offset use of regenerating woody species. We assessed female elk habitat use at the landscape, home range, and burned area scales using distance analyses techniques, diet analyses, and browsing data. Across the landscape, elk selected home ranges with a grassland component. Selection of home ranges across the landscape was not influenced by the burned area within 4 years post-fire. Within home ranges, preference for burned area was similar to other habitats suggesting the burned area played a more important role at the home range scale compared to the landscape scale, particularly during drought. The presence of graminoids in elk pellets collected from the burned area increased while shrubs decreased over time. The decrease in shrubs may have been due to an increase in graminoid production after the fire. Applying burn treatments to transitory ranges in the Jemez Mountains at a rate that will maintain growth of early to mid-seral stage vegetation may help off-set use of sensitive woody plant communities via the production of graminoids. Re-seeding grasses immediately following fire may help to reduce herbivore use of woody plants such as aspen during the earlier stages of re-growth.",http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3955/046.084.0103,Article,2010

Despite this interest, indicators of aspen conditions are poorly understood, and there is a lack of systematic monitoring of stable aspen landscapes. Stable aspen are defined here as being predominantly aspen overstorey (>80% basal area) with little or no conifer regeneration. We examined a putative stable aspen landscape in southern Utah and addressed (1) stand structure and (2) indicators of decline. We sampled 83 aspen-dominated stands within a 275 km2 landscape using established forest health monitoring protocols. Eighty-four percent of sample stands on Cedar Mountain exhibited stable aspen characteristics. Principal findings include: (1) a relatively uniform age of adults within the study area; (2) approximately 10% crown dieback on half of the plots sampled; (3) roughly 50% of the study plots had greater than 50% of the trees with damage to the bole; (4) about 25% of the adult basal area was dead; and (5) over half the plots had few sub-canopy individuals and/or limited regeneration. Physiographic variables including elevation, slope, and aspect were generally not strong indicators of aspen condition, typically explaining less than 15% of the variation in basal area, mortality, dieback, or damage. Healthy stands were rarely observed in the most drought prone locations, though the inverse was not necessarily true; healthy and unhealthy stands were found in more mesic settings. Principal components analysis identified two clusters of plots that differed considerably in regeneration; however, no other variables differed between these groupings. We suggest exogenous factors such as land-use history or altered disturbance regimes and endogenous factors such as soils and geology influence aspen condition on this landscape.

By 2008 it affected at least 220,000 ha, an estimated 17% of the aspen cover type in the state. In southwestern Colorado, we examined site and stand features in paired healthy and damaged plots to assess the effects of SAD on aspen and to identify factors associated with decline. Root mortality increased significantly with recent crown loss. Consequently, density of regeneration did not increase as the overstory deteriorated, and regeneration that originated since 2002 decreased significantly in stands with moderate to severe SAD. However, mortality of regeneration did not increase with that of the overstory. Remeasurement of a subset of plots after 1–2 yrs showed significant increases in severity. Contrary to expectations, overstory age and diameter were not related to SAD severity as measured by recent crown loss or mortality. Severity of SAD was inversely, but weakly, related to basal area, stem slenderness, and site index, and positively related to upper slope positions. This is consistent with moisture stress as an underlying factor. To test the role of climate as an inciting factor for SAD, a landscape-scale climate model was used to compare moisture status of declining and healthy aspen at the height of the warm drought in water year 2002. Polygons identified as damaged aspen in the 2008 aerial survey had greater moisture deficits than healthy aspen in the 2002 water year. SAD has led to loss of aspen cover in some stands, and is occurring in areas where early loss of aspen due to climate change has been predicted. Further warm, dry growing seasons will likely lead to recurrence of SAD.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6X-50B49SF-1&_user=464852&_coverDate=07/30/2010&_rdoc=9&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235042%232010%23997399994%232226749%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=5042&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=39&_acct=C000022310&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=464852&md5=3ee4c3d88b22ea2bb3e544197c3347d2&searchtype=a,Article,2010

Phyllocnistis populiella feeds on the epidermal cells of P. tremuloidesleaves. Eleven days after the onset of leaf mining, concentrations of the phenolic glycosides tremulacin and salicortin were significantly higher in aspen leaves that had received natural levels of leaf mining than in leaves sprayed with insecticide to reduce mining damage. In a second experiment, we examined the time course of induction in more detail. The levels of foliar phenolic glycosides in naturally mined ramets increased relative to the levels in insecticide-treated ramets on the ninth day following the onset of leaf mining. Induction occurred while some leaf miner larvae were still feeding and when leaves had sustained mining over 5% of the leaf surface. Leaves with extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) had significantly higher constitutive and induced levels of phenolic glycosides than leaves lacking EFNs, but there was no difference in the ability of leaves with and without EFNs to induce phenolic glycosides in response to mining. Previous work showed that the extent of leaf mining damage was negatively related to the total foliar phenolic glycoside concentration, suggesting that phenolic glycosides deter or reduce mining damage. The results presented here demonstrate that induction of phenolic glycosides can be triggered by relatively small amounts of mining damage confined to the epidermal tissue, and that these changes in leaf chemistry occur while a subset of leaf miners are still feeding within the leaf.",http://www.springerlink.com/content/47228427q48257r4/,Article,2010

Populus tremuloides expresses extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) on a subset of its leaves. We studied short and tall naturally occurring aspen ramets across multiple sites in interior Alaska. Contrary to our expectations, foliar phenolic glycoside concentrations were approximately 30% greater on leaves bearing EFNs than on leaves without EFNs.

Some specialized vertebrate herbivores have been shown to select plants differentially according to plant genotype, but examples from generalists, which constitute the vast majority of vertebrate herbivores, are few, especially in natural conditions. We examined the relationship between the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), a generalist mammalian herbivore, and clonal trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), a preferred food source of porcupines. We determined preference for certain aspen trees through visual examination of porcupine climbing scars left on tree bark, and through a controlled feeding experiment. We used genetic and biochemical analyses to link the behavioral archives (climbing scars) left by porcupines on aspen trunks to the clonal structure and chemical composition of trees. We show that two phenolic glycosides (tremulacin and salicortin), which are under a high degree of genetic control and thus vary in concentration across clones, are the chemical variables that most influence (deter) feeding choices by porcupines. Using behavioral archives left by a wild herbivore on a natural stand of plants thus allowed us to demonstrate that a generalist vertebrate herbivore can choose plants according to their clonal structure and genetically based chemical composition.

This loss of aspen ecosystems negatively impacts watersheds, wildlife, plants, and recreation. Much can still be done to restore aspen if timely and appropriate action is taken. However, land managers often lack fundamental information on the location, quantity, and status of aspen stands. This information is needed to plan, implement, and defend aspen restoration activities, but it is often difficult and costly to obtain. Advances in remote sensing technologies can provide cost-effective ways to obtain spatial and quantitative information about aspen to support restoration activities at multiple scales. With sponsorship from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Remote Sensing Steering Committee, the Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center conducted three pilot studies to develop remote sensing methods for obtaining key information about aspen. Efforts were focused primarily on developing a method to create a stratified probability map of aspen cover from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery for a study area located in the Custer National Forest. Photo-interpreted samples of the strata yielded estimates of the aspen cover present in each stratum. This product can greatly increase the efficiency of planning restoration activities and collecting associated field data.

We implemented 33 combinations of intensity and season of browse on aspen suckers in three aspen stands on Eagle Lake Range District, Lassen National Forest, California, USA, during 2003 and 2004. Greatest growth was on suckers with no terminal leader browse and ≤ 25% of biomass removed from branches. Lowest growth occurred when 90% of terminal leader length and 50% of branch biomass was removed. Growth was most negatively affected by browse on terminal leader. Growth was lowest for suckers browsed midseason only and suckers browsed both early and midseason. Occurrence of conifer in the stand overstory significantly reduced sucker growth.

Damage was inflicted to the roots by driving a large farm tractor over them, and a covering treatment was applied using a polystyrene board to prevent suckers from emerging from the soil. Soil temperatures for the winter-cut root systems were kept at 5 8C over the growing season, using a water bath, while for the summer-cut root systems soil temperatures were maintained at 17 8C over the growing season. In the winter-cut root systems, both log storage and root wounding caused a 40% reduction in living root mass and carbohydrate reserves, as well as reducing sucker numbers and their growth performance.

Aspen habitats are among the most diverse plant communities in this region and loss of these habitats can result in shifts in biodiversity, productivity, and hydrology across a range of spatial scales. Western aspen occurs on the majority of sites seral to conifer species, and long-term maintenance of these aspen woodlands requires periodic fire. Over the past century, fire intervals, extents, and intensities have been insufficient to regenerate aspen stands at historic rates; however the effects of various fire regimes and management scenarios on aspen vegetation dynamics at broad spatial and temporal scales are unexplored. Here we use field data, remotely sensed data, and fire atlas information to develop a spatially explicit landscape simulation model to assess the effects of current and historic wildfire regimes and prescribed burning programs on landscape vegetation composition across two mountain ranges in the Owyhee Plateau, Idaho. Model outputs depict the future structural makeup and species composition of the landscape at selected time steps under simulated management scenarios. We found that under current fire regimes and in the absence of management activities, loss of seral aspen stands will continue to occur over the next two centuries. However, a return to historic fire regimes (burning 12–14% of the modeled landscape per decade) would maintain the majority of aspen stands in early and mid seral woodland stages and minimizes the loss of aspen. A fire rotation of 70–80 years was estimated for the historic fire regime while the current fire regime resulted in a fire rotation of 340–450 years, underscoring the fact that fire is currently lacking in the system. Implementation of prescribed burning programs, treating aspen and young conifer woodlands according to historic fire occurrence probabilities, are predicted to prevent conifer dominance and loss of aspen stands.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VBS-4TS239H-1&_user=464852&_coverDate=01/24/2009&_rdoc=9&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235934%232009%23997799997%23742052%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=5934&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=14&_acct=C000022310&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=464852&md5=d85df3ff38e929e5f851149029187c54&searchtype=a,Article,2009

These effects may be especially important when the herbivore is an introduced species. Utilizing large mammal exclosures to prevent access by introduced elk at multiple sites along a fire chronosequence, we examined the effects of elk herbivory and fire on soil microbial activity and nutrient availability. Using time since fire as a co-variate and herbivore exclosures, paired with areas outside of the exclosures, we hypothesized that reductions in plant biomass due to herbivory would reduce organic inputs to soils and impact soil microbial activities and nutrient storage. We found three major patterns: (1) when elk were excluded, surface mineral soils had higher soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), microbial N pools, and increased extra-cellular enzyme activity of a C-acquiring enzyme across a gradient of time since fire. (2) When introduced elk are present, the activity of some extracellular enzymes as well as NO3 −availability are enhanced in the soil but the post-fire patterns described above with respect to nutrient accrual over time are delayed. (3) Herbivory by an introduced ungulate upsets the trajectory of ecosystem “recovery” after wildfire and delays soil C and N dynamics by an estimated 14.5–21 years, respectively.

Due to this obligation, there is a need for reliable, functional and practicable methods for specifying these distinctive characters. We have developed a clone identification method for European and hybrid aspens and curly birch, based on nuclear microsatellites, which can be used for determining the distinctive characters mentioned in the directive. For aspens, we have used 18 loci, of which nine were developed earlier for P. tremuloides and nine for P. nigra. For curly birch (Betula pendula var. carelica), we have used seven loci developed for B. pendula and three loci developed for B. platyphylla var. japonica. Most of the aspen clones were easily identifiable using only part of the loci. In the case of curly birch, however, two clones could not be separated from each other despite the relatively high number and polymorphism of the loci, which suggests that these two clones were actually samples from the same clone. These kinds of mistakes further emphasise the urgent need for a reliable clone identification method.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8735&context=aspen_bib,Article,2008

The trees were measured for gas exchange, leaf size, date of leaf abscission, size and biochemical characteristics of the overwintering buds and early leaf development during the 8th–9th year of free-air CO2 and O3 exposure at the Aspen FACE site located near Rhinelander, WI. Net photosynthesis was enhanced 49–73% by elevated [CO2], and decreased 13–30% by elevated [O3]. Elevated [CO2] delayed, and ele- vated [O3] tended to accelerate, leaf abscission in autumn. Ele- vated [CO2] increased the ratio of monosaccharides to di- and oligosaccharides in aspen buds, which may indicate a lag in cold acclimation. The total carbon concentration in over- wintering buds was unaffected by the treatments, although ele- vated [O3] decreased the amount of starch by 16% in birch buds, and reduced the size of aspen buds, which may be related to the delayed leaf development in aspen during the spring. Ele- vated [CO2] generally ameliorated the effects of elevated [O3]. Our results show that both elevated [CO2] and elevated [O3] have the potential to alter carbon metabolism of overwintering buds. These changes may cause carry-over effects during the next growing season.",http://treephys.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/2/243.long,Article,2008

Fire suppression, grazing and wildlife management practices, and climate patterns of the past century are all potential threats to aspen coverage in this region. If aspen-dependent species are losing habitat, this raises concerns about their long-term viability. Though lichens have a rich history as air pollution indicators, we believe that they may also be useful as a metric of community diversity associated with habitat change. We established 47 plots in the Bear River Range of northern Utah and southern Idaho to evaluate the effects of forest succession on epiphytic macrolichen communities. Plots were located in a narrow elevational belt (2134–2438 m) to minimize the known covariant effects of elevation and moisture on lichen communities. Results show increasing total lichen diversity and a decrease in aspen-dependent species as aspen forests succeed to conifer cover types. The interactive roles of stand aspect, basal area and cover of dominant trees, stand age, aspen bark scars, and recent tree damage were examined as related to these trends. We developed an aspen index score based on lichens showing an affinity for aspen habitat (Phaeophyscia nigricans, Physcia tenella, Xanthomendoza fulva, Xanthomendoza galericulata) and found a significant negative relationship between the index and successional progression. Indicator species analysis showed the importance of all stages of aspen-conifer succession for lichen community diversity and highlighted the decline of aspen-dependent species with advancing succession. We present a landscape-level community analysis of lichens in the context of a conceptual model for aspen succession for the southern Rocky Mountains. We conclude that while total number of lichen species increases with succession, aspen-dependent species cover and richness will decline. In this way, epiphytic lichens communities may constitute an effective indicator of community-level diversity in for aspen-dependent species at-large.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811270800460X,Article,2008

In a growth chamber experiment we tested the transfer of N through living feather moss or aspen litter when fertilized with urea ((NH2)2CO) or NH4NO3 at a rate of 100 kg ha−1 and under different watering regimes. When these organic substrates were frequently watered to excess they allowed the highest transfer of nutrients through, although 72% of the applied fertilizer was captured in the substrates. In a field experiment we also fertilized moss and aspen litter with urea ((NH2)2CO) or NH4NO3 at a more operationally relevant rate of 330 kg ha−1. We captured the NO3− or NH4+ by ion exchange resin at the substrate–mineral soil interface. In contrast to the growth chamber experiment, this fertilizer rate killed the moss and there was no detectable increase in nutrient levels in the aspen litter or feather moss layers. Instead, the urea was more likely transferred into the mineral soil; mineral soil of the urea treatment had 1.6 times as much extractable N compared to the NH4NO3 treatment. This difference between the growth chamber and field studies was attributed to observed fertilizer- damage to the living moss and possibly damage to the litter microflora due to the higher rate of fertilization in the field. In addition, the early and substantial rainfall after fertilization in the field experiment produced conditions for rapid leaching of N through the organic layers into the mineral soil. In the field, only 8% of the urea-N that was applied was captured by the ion exchange resin, while 34% was captured in for the NH4NO3 fertilization. Thus, the conditions for rapid leaching in the field moved much of the N in the form of urea through the organic layers and into the mineral soil before it was hydrolyzed.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4479&context=aspen_bib,Article,2008

Further, very few studies have examined whether mammalian herbivores can act as agents of natural selection for plant traits. We examined the hypothesis that variation in aspen phytochemistry resulted in selective herbivory by Cervus elaphus (elk), an introduced mammalian herbivore. With the experimental removal of a large elk exclosure, elk selectively eliminated 60% of an aspen population previously protected from herbivory resulting in a dramatic shift in the phytochemical composition of the aspen forest. Selection gradients (β) varied from 0.52 to 0.66, well above average relative to other studies of selection. These results indicate that introduced herbivores can have rapid evolutionary consequences even on long lived native species. Because there are fundamental links between phytochemistry, biodiversity and ecosystem processes, the effects of an introduced herbivore are likely to have cascading impacts on the services ecosystems provide.",http://www.springerlink.com/content/f14025713p147367/,Article,2007

From 2003 to 2007, we monitored aspen mortality and regeneration, and measured associated stand and site variables on randomly-selected sites of the Coconino National Forest where aerial survey had detected dieback or decline. Year of death was observed or estimated since 2000. Xerophytic forests sustained greater mortality than mesophytic forests. Aspen on low-elevation xeric sites (<7500 ft) sustained 95% mortality since 2000. Mid-elevation sites (7500–8500 ft) lost 61% of aspen stems during the same time period; mortality is expected to continue in these sites because some remaining trees have 70 to 90% crown dieback. Less aspen mortality (16%) was observed on more mesic high-elevation sites (>8500 ft). Low-elevation sites are located on northerly aspects while mid- and high-elevation sites are located on various aspects. Overall, diameter distributions showed mortality was not skewed to any particular size class, however, trees with diameters >9 inches generally took longer to die than smaller size classes. Several insects and pathogens were associated with aspen mortality but appeared to be acting as secondary agents on stressed trees. Although aspen ramet production occurred to some degree on all sites with the death of mature trees, aspen sprouts were nearly nonexistent by the summer of 2007 due to browsing by elk and deer. None of the sites studied are grazed currently by domestic cattle. Widespread mortality of mature aspen trees, chronic browsing by ungulates, and advanced conifer reproduction is expected to result in rapid vegetation change of many ecologically unique and important sites.",http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5238468.pdf,Contribution to Book,2007

However, large aspen have largely been removed from managed forests, whereas regeneration and the long-term persistence of mature trees in protected areas are matters of concern. We recorded the numbers of mature (≥20cm diameter) aspen in old-growth and managed forests in eastern Finland, based on a large-scale inventory (11400ha, 36000 living and dead trees). In addition, saplings and small aspen trees were surveyed on thirty-six 1 ha sample plots. The average volumes of mature living and dead aspen were 4.0 and 1.3m3/ha in continuous old-growth forests and 0.2 and 0.6m3/ha in managed forests, respectively. These results indicate that large aspen trees in managed forests are a legacy of the past, when forest landscapes were less intensively managed. We conclude that the long-term persistence of aspen in protected areas can only be secured by means of restoration measures that create gaps large enough for regeneration to occur. More emphasis should be given to sparing aspen during thinning and to retaining mature aspen during regeneration cutting in managed forests.",http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nrc/cjfr/2007/00000037/00000006/art00008,Article,2007

3163,Paul C. Rogers,"Factors Influencing Epiphytic Lichen Communities in Aspen-Associated Forests of Bear River Range, Idaho and Utah",Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,"In western North America, quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is the most common hardwood in montane landscapes. Fire suppression, grazing, wildlife management practices, and climate patterns of the past century are some of the threats to aspen coverage in this region. Researchers are concerned that aspen-dependent species may be losing habitat, thereby threatening their long-term local and regional viability. Though lichens have a rich history as air pollution indicators, I believe that they may also be useful as a metric of community diversity associated with habitat change. To date, few studies have specifically examined the status of aspen's epiphytic lichen community in the Rocky Mountains. A preliminary study was conducted using 10 transect-based plots to assess lichen species substrate preferences between aspen and various conifer species and to gain basic knowledge of species diversity. Following this work, I established 47 plots in the Bear River Range of northern Utah and southern Idaho to evaluate the effects of forest succession on epiphytic macrolichen communities. Plots were located in a narrow elevational belt (2,134-2,438 m) to minimize the known covariant effects of elevation and moisture on lichen communities. Results show increasing lichen diversity and a decrease in aspen-dependent species as aspen forests succeed to conifer cover types. The interactive roles of stand aspect, basal area and cover of dominant trees, stand age, aspen bark scars, and recent tree damage were examined in relation to these trends. An aspen index score was developed based on lichens showing an affinity for aspen habitat. I present a landscape-level multivariate analysis of shortand long-term factors influencing epiphytic lichen communities in aspen forests. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination stressed the importance of succession and local air pollution sources in shaping lichen communities. I also investigated the role of historic human intrusions and climate on aspen forests and aspen-dependent epiphytic lichens at the landscape-level. Implications of this work include (1) realization of nitrogen impacts on ecosystems, (2) the potential for using lichens as bioindicators for monitoring aspen stand health, and (3) suggestions for working with natural disturbance regimes to minimize human impacts on aspen and associated species.",http://search.proquest.com/pqdtft/docview/304801783/abstract/13A5AEE5BE149518E97/1?accountid=14761,Thesis/Dissertation,2007

Areas severely damaged by elk are commonly protected with woven wire fence, which can exclude other animals. Complete exclusion and prevention of large mammal herbivory might not always be necessary to restore vegetative communities. We designed and evaluated a simple fence that excluded elk, but maintained access for deer and other species. We enclosed a 1-ha stand of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) with our fence in an area with a high density of elk. We monitored effectiveness of the fence with trackplots, animal-activated cameras, and changes in aspen stem height and density. We documented only 1 elk within the exclosure in 2 years of monitoring. Mammals that used the exclosure included beaver (Castor canadensis), black bear (Ursus americanus), bobcat(Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), deer (Odocoileus spp.), mountain lion (Puma concolor), raccoon (Procyon lotor), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and lagomorph (Leporidae). After 1 year of protection, mean aspen stem height increased 14.5 cm more inside the exclosure than outside, but stem density in the exclosure changed little compared to outside. Our fence design effectively excluded elk and has potential for protecting a variety of resources.",http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2111/1551-5028(2007)60[529:AFDFEE]2.0.CO;2,Article,2007

In contrast, forest vegetation along the northern edge of the North American Great Plains has migrated southward over the past century into areas dominated by native grassland. Because climate change is also predicted to increase storm frequency and intensity, we quantified the impacts of an intense hailstorm on woody and herbaceous species in native grassland in the northern Great Plains of North America. The hailstorm disturbance killed or damaged mature stems of the dominant tree, aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), but damaged aspen stands subsequently invaded ca. 10m into neighbouring grassland. Damaged aspen stands also produced up to 20-fold more new stems having 67-fold higher total biomass compared with relatively undisturbed stands. Grasses and lichens suffered much higher rates of biomass removal (60%-76%) than did shrubs (6%-8%) immediately following the storm. The disturbance-mediated recruitment of clonal woody plants, and the unexpected sensitivity of grasses and lichens to this disturbance, may contribute to the counterintuitive expansion of trees into grasslands under a regime of increased storm frequency that is not predicted by simple ecosystem responses to warming.",http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nrc/cjb/2006/00000084/00000007/art00012,Article,2006

Particular attention was given to the effect of the diameter and location of the root cutting in regard to the sprouting and rooting efficiency (the percentage of sprouted or rooted cuttings). The length of sprouting and rooting time was also measured. Cloning affected strongly all factors related to regeneration efficiency. The root system structure defined the amount of root cuttings and affected their ability to sprout and root. Practically, root cuttings taken from all parts of the root system of hybrid aspen were capable of producing new shoots and roots. However, the sprouting was better if the cutting was located further from the root collar. The diameter of the cutting did not affect the sprouting efficiency, but it had a strong impact on rooting: the rooting efficiency lowered with increasing root diameter. The clones differed significantly in sprouting time. The diameter and location of the root cutting correlated significantly with sprouting time: thicker root cuttings originating near the root collar produced shoots faster than thinner cuttings from the distal parts of the root system. Cloning, diameter class or location of cuttings had no significant effect on rooting time. For commercial scale hybrid aspen propagation it is essential to use stock plants that are at the most 2-year-old and to select only the vigorously regenerating clones which have a large root system, but relatively thin, long roots.",Not found,Article,2006

Using point counts and vegetation assessments from 462 individual stations between 2001 and 2003 allowed us to investigate important habitat features at watershed and regional scales. Several trends were found: bird species richness and abundance were positively correlated with lower percent conifer cover, increased herbaceous cover, and lower shrub-class aspen cover. Dusky Flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri) presence and abundance were positively correlated with increased percent shrub-class aspen cover and lower percent tree-class cover of all conifers or individual coniferous species. Warbling Vireo (Vireo gilvus) presence and abundance were positively correlated with increased percent tree-class aspen cover. The results suggest that mature aspen stands with healthy herbaceous communities and limited or no conifer intrusion are optimal habitats for aspen-breeding birds in the eastern Sierra Nevada. To maximize bird species richness and bird abundance, management actions in aspen stands should concen- trate on conifer removal, where conditions warrant, and the promotion of a healthy herbaceous layer. Conservation planning for birds in aspen habitats of the Sierra Nevada is discussed.",http://data.prbo.org/apps/snamin/uploads/images/aspen/Richardson_Heath_2005_Aspen.pdf,Article,2005

Results of the studies used to formulate this treatment model are presented along with recommenda- tions for innovative treatments to restore aspen in landscapes where it is rare or in decline. Soils and site productivity, competition from other plants, and the potential impact of browsing animals upon new regeneration should all be considered. Choosing a course of action depends upon a careful evaluation of the size, vigor, age, and successional status of candidate aspen clones. Treatments may include doing nothing, removal of existing aspen trees, removal of competing vegetation, prescribed burning, mechanical root stimulation, and browse protection.",http://www.tws-west.org/transactions/Shepperd%20aspen%20restoration.pdf,Article,2005

This study was under- taken to 1) assess the distribution of white rings within trembling aspen stems and 2) to quantify the anatomical differences between white rings and the ʻnormalʼ rings formed in the previous year. Both stem analysis and image analysis were used. Several cross sections from six trees were dated and the presence of white rings on each disc was recorded. The development of white rings from the base up to about 70% of stem height was found to be uniform. Results from the comparison of eleven white and normal rings indicated that white rings were narrower and less dense than normal rings. The anatomical variable with the most discriminating power was average fiber wall thickness. White rings have smaller fiber diameter with little secondary cell wall thickening resulting in a higher proportion of fiber lumen. Possible mechanisms involved in the formation of white rings are discussed. It is speculated that defoliation affects the growth hormone complex inducing earlier cessation of xylem growth and reallocation of reserves to the production of new foliage. The occurrence of white rings in many diffuse-porous species stresses the potential for identification of periods of intense defoliation episodes. Increased interest in the dendroecology of diffuse-porous species may confirm their wide- spread occurrence.,http://ion.uwinnipeg.ca/~jtardif/IMAGES/2005IAWAJ.pdf,Article,2005

In May and June of 2002 and 2003, 228 bird species were recorded along 316 ten-point transects in fifteen distinct habitat types of Nevada. In this status report, basic abundance patterns among habitat types are discussed for 35 bird species identified as conservation priorities for Nevada. Results suggested that in some cases, even basic habitat associations of priority birds were slightly different than previously assumed for the Nevada region, demonstrating that quantitative measurement of bird-habitat use is needed as a first step in effective habitat conservation planning. Changes in habitat use across different climatic conditions, e.g. droughts and normal water years, need to be assessed as the program becomes implemented in the longer- term. Also, for some species, especially in the Mojave region of Nevada, additional data are needed to clarify habitat associations. The next two years of implementing the NBC program will focus on these objectives and on generating multi-species habitat suitability models for priority species associated with aspen, lowland riparian, mesquite-catclaw, sagebrush, and pinyon-juniper habitats.",http://water.nv.gov/hearings/past/springetal/browseabledocs/Exhibits%5CGBWN%20Exhibits/GBWN_Exh_173%20DDC%20Exh%20560%20Ammon%202003.pdf,Report,2004

This decline is especially marked in young and intermediate stands due to the lack of regeneration. Aspen regeneration is nowadays mainly restricted to abandoned agricultural land. The decrease of aspen is of particular concern as it has more host-specific species than any other boreal tree species. The main question addressed is whether regenerating aspen stands in agricultural habitats can compensate for the deficiency of young stands in the forest. Data on epiphytic macrolichens show that cyanolichens increased, in number and frequency, with stand age in the forest landscape, and that there was a striking difference in species composition between stands in the two landscapes. Lichens with cyanobacterial and green-algal photobionts dominated in the forest and agricultural stands, respectively. Notably, cyanolichens were not found in stands younger than 50 yr in the forest, and stands younger than 100 yr in the agricultural landscape. This difference between the landscapes cannot be explained by stand age, stand size or isolation. Instead, differences in habitat quality, due to differences in the physical environment associated with the presence of conifers in the older forest stands, appear to be involved. We suggest that in order to conserve cyanolichens that are confined to aspen, active management practices have to be adopted that promote the regeneration of aspen in the forest landscape, and the establishment of conifers in areas where aspen regeneration is confined to the agricultural landscape. In addition, until new aspen stands with appropriate physical environments have been established, these measures must be combined with the preservation of existing old-growth stands, which can provide appropriate source populations.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03866.x/epdf,Article,2004

To estimate canopy fuel stratum characteristics of four broad fuel types found in the western United States and adjacent areas of Canada, namely Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, and lodgepole pine forest stands, data from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database were analysed and linked with tree-level foliage dry weight equations. Models to predict canopy base height (CBH), canopy fuel load (CFL) and canopy bulk density (CBD) were developed through linear regression analysis and using common stand descriptors (e.g. stand density, basal area, stand height) as explanatory variables. The models developed were fuel type specific and coefficients of determination ranged from 0.90 to 0.95 for CFL, between 0.84 and 0.92 for CBD and from 0.64 to 0.88 for CBH. Although not formally evaluated, the models seem to give a reasonable characterization of the canopy fuel stratum for use in fire management applications.",http://www.sierraforestlegacy.org/Resources/Conservation/FireForestEcology/FireScienceResearch/FireEcology/FireEcology-Cruz03.pdf,Article,2003

These properties are both genetically determined and influenced by environmental stimuli. Induction of reaction wood is an environmentally induced process involving changes in growth rate and fibre properties that can be readily studied. Plant hormones are signalling agents that play important roles in the initiation and coordination of wood formation; in this thesis the plant hormones auxin and ethylene were investigated using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).,http://pub.epsilon.slu.se/175/1/91-576-6502-8.fulltext.pdf,Thesis/Dissertation,2003

Altogether 232 taxa of lichens, lichenicolous fungi, or non-lichenized fungi were recorded, 10 of them listed in the Estonian Red Data Book. We found regional differences in lichen species composition and diversity caused by differences in the forest types. The tree-species-rich boreo-nemoral forests had the most diverse lichen flora, while the boreal forest dominated by coniferous trees or birch had the lowest diversity. The stand age proved to be significant in regard to the number of lichen species in a forest. The most remarkable effect on the diversity of forest lichen species was caused by the presence of Populus tremula. Aspen had the highest number of lichen species on the basal trunk and twigs, and also the highest number of host-specific lichen species.",http://www.springerlink.com/content/g0450102q3n5gw4r/,Article,2003

Our objective was to characterize the carabid fauna in three mature boreal forest types (conifer, mixedwood, and deciduous) and a disturbed habitat (clearcut) to provide baseline data on the carabid species inhabiting the major forest types of boreal northwestern Ontario. Only spring-active carabids were considered for logistical reasons. We further identified the coarse woody debris structure and microhabitat characteristics within these stand types to try to refine our ability to predict the within-stand occurrence of carabids. We found the carabid composition of deciduous stands (mixedwood and aspen) similar and typical of the carabid fauna found in mixedwood forest in other nearby studies. The important feature of these forest types may be the presence of a deciduous leaf litter layer. In contrast, spruce stands contained fewer species and individuals and a distinct carabid fauna. As pre- dicted, the clearcut habitats were dominated by open habitat species, although the fauna was dissimilar to what was recorded in clearcut habitats in other studies within northwestern Ontario. Coarse woody debris appeared to be an important hab- itat attribute for several carabid species in clearcut habitats.",http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid=8482739&jid=TCE&volumeId=135&issueId=03&aid=8482737,Article,2003

Sexton,"Models for the distribution of quaking aspen in geographic and potential evapotranspiration spaces relevant to the Book Cliffs (Utah), 2000-2002",Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,"Quaking aspen is the most widely distributed tree species in North America and an asset to sociological, ecological, and hydrological land values in the western United States. In recognition of these values, land managers seek means to oppose a regional decline of aspen in the Intermountain West—a decline apparently in progress since the close of the Pleistocene and driven by climate change, fire suppression, and increasing ungulate densities. One location of special relevance to this decline is the Utah-Colorado Book Cliffs, a discrete boundary of quaking aspen’s geographic range and a potential biogeographic corridor between the sub-alpine communities of the Utah and Colorado Rocky Mountains. To inform land management plans for the Book Cliffs and develop methods applicable on public lands across the region, a spatial database of aspen concentration, potential, and threat was created for a 10 450-ha pilot section of the area. Raster GIS data layers of fuzzy landcover concentration and monthly potential evapotranspiration (pET) were created from field measurements and satellite remotely sensed imagery. The Hutchinsonian niche concept was generalized with fuzzy-sets and likelihood theories to accommodate measurements of continuous landcover-class membership, and values of aspen’s fuzzy Hutchinsonian niche were regressed over a ~10% sample of the aspen-pET cells using regression trees. Applying the niche model over the cell population created an aspen pET-habitat map, and subtracting measured from expected concentrations created a map of potential aspen concentration change. Validation of aspen’s model pET niche showed that aspen concentration is strongly constrained by unmanageable water relations, but aspen’s high spatial aggregation suggests that net-positive local feedbacks maintain aspen concentration above expectation at many locations. Also, under-occupation of aspen habitat is strongly correlated with Douglas-fir concentration, and by manipulating the latter two factors within the limits imposed by water balance, aspen physiology, and management logistics, the landscape may be coarsely managed to increase aspen concentrations. These results are to be used in the Book Cliffs as spatially explicit hypotheses for adaptive ecosystem management, these methods are under consideration for application in similar ecoregions, and these interpretations may better accommodate niche theory to geographic ecology.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8063&context=aspen_bib,Thesis/Dissertation,2003

Severely-stressed seedlings were also rewatered for 24 h to determine the effects of water deficit stress and stress recovery on root water flow properties. Both stress levels and stress recovery treatment reduced leaf stomatal conductance and shoot water potentials. However, root volume flux density and hydraulic conductivity were inhibited only by the severe water deficit stress and did not recover within 24 h following rewatering. The inhibition of root hydraulic conductivity in severely-stressed plants was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of apoplastic root water flow, as determined by the trisodium 3-hydroxy-5,8,10-pyrenetrisulfonate fluorescent tracer dye. In all treatments and control, the mean activation energy values for root water flow were lower than 6 kcal mol−1, pointing to the presence of AQP-mediated transport. However, compared with earlier studies using solution culture-grown aspen seedlings, mercuric chloride had relatively little effect on root volume flux density. We interpreted this result as likely due to limited penetration of the root cortex by mercuric chloride through the exodermal layer.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168945203001493,Article,2003

Tuskan",Post-Fire Aspen Seedling Recruitment Across the Yellowstone (Usa) Landscape,Landscape Ecology,18,2,127 - 140,Not found,"Landscape patterns of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedling occurrence and abundance were studied after a rare recruitment event following the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. Belt transects (1 to 17 km in length, 4 m width) along 18 foot trails were surveyed for aspen seedlings on the subalpine plateau of the Park, along gradients of elevation and geologic substrate, during the summer of 1996. Aspen seedling presence and density were characterized as a function of elevation, geologic substrate, slope, aspect, vegetation/cover type, presence of burned forest, and distance to nearest adult aspen stand. Presence of aspen seedlings was best predicted by the incidence of burned forest and proximity to adult aspen; aspen seedlings were only found in burned forest and were more likely to occur closer to adult aspen clones. When tested against independent data collected in 1997, the logistic regression model for aspen seedling presence performed well (overall accuracy = 73%, Taup = 0.41). When present, variation in aspen seedling density at local scales (≤ 200 m) was largely explained by elevation, with higher densities observed at lower elevations. At broad scales (> 1 km), seedling density was a function of cover type, elevation, aspect, slope, and burn severity, with greater seedling density in more severely burned forested habitats on southerly, shallow slopes at lower elevations. Aspen seedling densities ranged from 0 to 46,000 seedlings/ha with a median density of 2,000/ha on sites where they occurred. Aspen seedlings were most abundant in the south central and southwest central regions of the park, approximately an order of magnitude less abundant in the southeast region, and nearly absent in the north central area. Establishment of new aspen stands on Yellowstone's subalpine plateau would represent a substantial change in the landscape.

We found that reuse of live trees over the medium-term (three years) was common and that, in some instances, reuse over the long-term (nine and 10 years) can occur. Our data also suggest that, over the medium-term, aspen roosts are reused by groups of bats more often than by solitary individuals.

There were differences in height and diameter growth among the trials on agricultural and forest land. The height increment during the third year was 66% higher, and the diameter increment 50% higher on forest land than agricultural land. The ranking of clones changed across sites, indicating significant site×clone interactions in height and basal diameter. Clone×site interaction were highly significant (P<0.001) in the overall analysis of variance. The variance component for the clone×site interaction was twice as high as that of clones for height and basal diameter in the second and third years, or for their increments during the third year.

We examined rates of nest-cavity reuse for a rich community of cavity-nesting birds in mixed forests in interior British Columbia. Using a sample of 402 cavity-reuse cases over five years, we measured cavity reuse for 20 cavity-nesting bird and mammal species (three guilds), and examined the relationship between nest-cavity reuse and features of cavities, nest trees, and forest stands. Eight percent of used cavities were destroyed between years. Reuse rates were 17% for the cavities of weak excavators such as nuthatches and chickadees, 28% for formerly active woodpecker nests, and 48% for cavities previously used by secondary cavity nesting birds, but there was considerable species variation within all guilds. Nest cavities in aspen that were deep with large entrances had the highest reuse. At the forest stand level, cavities in trees close to edges and in sites with more edge habitat had greater reuse. Reused cavities tended to be occupied in sequential years rather than being inactive for a year. With increasing amounts of managed landscapes, availability of suitable cavities for forest nesting vertebrates is decreasing. Reuse of existing cavities might help mitigate the problem of nest-site limitation.",http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0391:NSRPFA]2.0.CO;2,Article,2002

BSP) forest in Canada was compared using a newly developed realistic model of surface-atmosphere exchanges of carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and energy as well as eddy covariance flux measurements made over a 6-year period (1994-1999). The model was developed by incorporating a process-based two-leaf (sunlit and shaded) canopy conductance and photosynthesis submodel in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS). A simple submodel of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration was combined with the photosynthesis model to simulate NEP. The model performed well in simulating half-hourly, daily, and monthly mean CO2 exchange and evaporation values in both deciduous and coniferous forests. Modeled and measured results showed a linear relationship between CO2 uptake and evaporation, and for each kilogram of water transpired, approximately 3 g of carbon (C) were photosynthesized by both ecosystems. The model results confirmed that the aspen forest was a weak to moderate C sink with considerable interannual variability in C uptake. In the growing season, the C uptake capacity of the aspen forest was over twice that of the black spruce forest. Warm springs enhanced NEP in both forests; however, high mid-summer temperatures appear to have significantly reduced NEP at the black spruce forest as a result of increased respiration. The model suggests that the black spruce forest is a weak C sink in cool years and a weak C source in warm years. These results show that the C balance of these two forests is sensitive to seasonal and interannual climatic variability and stresses the importance of continuous long-term flux measurement to confirm modeling results.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/x01-228#.UQgtT0qjeYo,Article,2002

Coarse roots ranged from 0.65 to 4.45 cm in diameter, whereas fine roots were less than 5 mm in diameter. To discrim- inate between maintenance and growth respiration, root respi- ration rates were measured during aboveground growing periods and dormant periods. An additional measurement of coarse root respiration was made during spring leaf flush, to evaluate the effect of mobilization of resources for leaf expan- sion on root respiration. Fine roots respired at much higher rates than coarse roots, with a mean rate at 15 °C of 1290 μmol CO2 m–3 s–1 during the growing period, and 660 μmol CO2 m–3 s–1 during the dormant period. The temperature response of fine root respiration rate was nonlinear: mean Q10 was 3.90 for measurements made at 5–15 °C and 2.19 for measurements made at 15–25 °C. Coarse root respiration rates measured at 15 °C in late fall (dormant season) were higher (370 μmol CO2 m–3 s–1) than rates from roots collected at leaf flush and early summer (200 μmol CO2 m–3 s–1). The higher respiration rates in late fall, which were accompanied by decreased total non- structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations, suggest that respiration rates in late fall included growth expenditures, re- flecting recent radial growth. Neither bud flush nor shoot growth of the trees caused an increase in coarse root respiration or a decrease in TNC concentrations, suggesting a limited role of coarse roots as reserve storage organs for spring shoot growth, and a lack of synchronization between above- and be- lowground growth. Pooling the data from the coarse and fine roots showed a positive correlation between nitrogen concen- tration and respiration rate.",http://treephys.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/10/725.full.pdf,Article,2002

Smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa praten- sis L.) are important herbage for livestock and wildlife in Aspen-Boreal ecosystems in central Alberta, but there is paucity of infor- mation on the relationship between soil moisture and defoliation regimes on herbage production in these ecosystems. In a greenhouse experiment, we evaluated the effect of Bromus-Poa defoliation frequencies (2 or 4 wks) and intensities (2.5, 7.5, or 15 cm above the soil surface) under three soil moisture regimes [field capacity (wet), 50% field capacity (moist), 20% field capacity (dry)] on dry matter (DM) yield. Crude protein (CP) content, crude protein yield (CPY) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were also determined for herbage harvested. Total accumulated shoot DM decreased under defoliation compared to the undefoliated control, was higher if plants were clipped every 4 wks, rather than 2 wks, and increased with increasing soil moisture availability. Defoliation regimes decreased root DM Compared to the undefoliated control. Soil moisture regime did not significantly affect below-ground DM production, but root:shoot ratio increased significantly with decreasing moisture supply. The average CP con- tent of grasses ranged from 12 to 23%, but was adequate to meet crude protein requirements of growing, pregnant or lactating graz- ing cattle (Bos spp.) The CPY decreased with increasing moisture stress, and was greatest when plants were clipped at a 7.5-cm height. Shoot NDF concentration increased with decreasing clipping frequency. These result indicate the need to investigate the rela- tionship between soil moisture and management practices that affect the productivity of tame pastures in Aspen-Boreal ecosystems.",http://pubs.aic.ca/doi/pdf/10.4141/P01-040,Article,2002

To investigate this mechanism of GA-controlled growth in hybrid aspen, we cloned cDNAs encoding gibberellin 20-oxidase (GA 20-oxidase), a key, highly regulated enzyme in the biosynthesis of GAs. Clones were isolated from leaf and cambium cDNA libraries using probes generated by polymerase chain reaction, based on conserved domains of GA 20-oxidases. Upon expression in Escherichia coli, the GST-fusion protein was shown to oxidise GA12 as well as oxidising the 13-hydroxylated substrate GA53, successively to GA9 and GA20, respectively. The gene PttGA20ox1 was expressed in meristematic cells and growing tissues such as expanding internodes, leaves and roots. The expression was negatively regulated by both GA4and overexpression of phytochrome A. RNA analysis also showed that the expression was down-regulated in late-expanding leaf tissue in response to short days (SDs). Actively growing tissues such as early elongating internodes, petioles and leaf blades had the highest levels of C19-GAs. Upon transfer to SDs an accumulation of GA19 was observed in early elongating internodes and leaf blades. The levels of C19-GAs were also to some extent changed upon transfer to SDs. The levels of GA20 were down-regulated in internodes, and those of GA1 were significantly reduced in early expanding leaf blades. In roots the metabolites GA19 and GA8decreased upon shifts to SDs, while GA20 accumulated slightly. The down-regulation of GA 20-oxidase activity in response to SDs was further indicated by studies of [14C]GA12 metabolism in shoots, demonstrating that the substrate for GA 20-oxidase, [14C]GA53, accumulates in SDs.",http://www.springerlink.com/content/v0n3lec6vn3y5kxx/,Article,2002

The objective of our study was therefore to obtain additional fine structural details on the deposition of cell wall components during the differentiation of xylem cells in hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L. ×P. tremuloides Michx.) we used as a model tree. At the electron microscope level, PATAg staining revealed a successive deposition of polysaccharides with increasing distance from the cambium. Staining with potassium permanganate and UV microspectrophotometry showed that the cell walls were lignified, with some delay to the deposition of polysaccharides. Immunogold labelling of three lignin types in developing cell walls varied with progressive deposition of cell wall layers. Condensed lignin subunits were localized in corners of cells adjacent to the cambium prior to S1 formation, whereas non-condensed lignin subunits became labelled only in later stages - in secondary walls near cell corners and simultaneously with the completion of S1 formation. As S2 polysaccharide deposition progressed, the labelling extended towards the lumen. Labelling of peroxidases revealed their presence in cell corner regions of young xylem cells, still lacking a secondary wall, implying that peroxidases are incorporated into the developing cell wall at early developmental stages. A weak labelling of middle lamella regions and secondary walls could also be seen at later stages. The results are discussed in relation to current knowledge on the succession of polysaccharide and lignin deposition in woody cell walls.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1055/s-2002-20431/abstract,Article,2002

The invasion of grasslands by woody plants is related to increased hetero- geneity in soil resources. At the northern edge of the Great Plains, the amount of hetero- geneity in soils reciprocally transplanted between prairie and aspen forest can change within a single growing season, suggesting that heterogeneity is strongly influenced by vegetation. Here we examine several mechanisms by which fine roots could influence soil resource heterogeneity. We measured the total length, spatial pattern, and turnover of fine roots in both prairie and forest using minirhizotrons installed horizontally 10 cm below the soil surface. The total length of fine roots in forest (0.7 cm/cm2) was significantly less than that in prairie (1.4 cm/cm2), which may contribute to more spatially variable resource uptake in forest. The coefficient of variation of root length was significantly higher in forest (92%) than in prairie (65%). Semivariograms showed that the scale of patchiness of root length was significantly greater in forest (8–12 cm) than in prairie (3–4 cm). Lastly, the rate of fine root turnover was significantly higher in forest (49%) than in prairie (20%). Turnover may contribute to spatial variability because a system with high rates of root turnover would appear to have high spatial variability at any given time. Root mortality was also signifi- cantly higher in forest than prairie. In summary, many aspects of root distributions and dynamics were consistent with relatively high heterogeneity in forest soil resources. The greater total root length in prairie may account for the significantly higher intensity of root competition in grasslands than forests and contribute to the exclusion of woody plants from prairies. Trees may be able to overcome this resistance by both causing and benefiting from higher levels and scales of soil resource heterogeneity.",http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/0012-9658%282002%29083%5B1199%3ARDASPI%5D2.0.CO%3B2,Article,2002

Model parameters were determined using data from forest stands at the Harvard Forest in Massachusetts Applications of the model reasonably simulated stand development over 120 hr for Populus tremuloides in Wisconsin and for Pinus elliottii in Florida. Our evaluation of tree-grass interactions simulated by the model indicated that competition for light let to dominance by the deciduous forest PFT in moist regions of eastern United States and that water competition led to dominance by the grass PFT in dry regions of the central United States.

Our goal is to identify the types of trees required to be retained during forestry operations if viable populations of cavity nesters are to be maintained in managed forests. Between 1994 and 1999, we recorded nesting species and tree characteristics during the year of first detection of active nest trees and in subsequent years, to document changes in wildlife use and tree condition. We located a total of 602 nests of 16 cavity-nesting species in 420 trees. Predominant tree species with active nests were Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western larch (Larix occidentalis), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera). More than half of all nest trees were dead and/or partially broken when first detected. Three to 4.5 percent of nest trees were lost due to uprooting or total breakage each year. Partial breakage occurred at average annual rates of 1.1 to 6.2 percent each year. During the study period, 30 percent of nest trees were reused by breeding cavity nesters.",http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/gtr-181/024_Steeger.pdf,Contribution to Book,2002

We studied songbirds 5–6 years post-fire in a large burn (9600 ha) in the boreal mixedwood forest of north-eastern Alberta. In the spring of 1995 and 1996 we estimated abundance of songbirds in four areas, each with four replicate sites: unburned patches within the fire (Isolates); burned patches (Burns); patches that had been clear-cut prior to burning by wildfire (Cut-Burns); and the unburned, continuous forest adjacent to the burn (Peripherals). We also sampled shrub-based arthropods with sweep-nets at each site. To investigate the role of Isolates, we compared them to Peripherals and to Burns. We compared Cut-Burns to Burns to examine the effect of logging prior to burning. In general, Isolates supported higher numbers of species and individuals than Peripherals, mainly due to higher numbers of aerial-foraging birds. Isolates and Burns had similar species richness and abundance, but Burns supported more aerial foragers while Isolates had more foliage gleaners. Cut-Burns generally supported fewer individuals than Burns, in particular fewer shrub-nesters, aerial foragers, and neotropical migrants. More bird species reached their highest densities in Burns than in any other area. Songbird species richness and abundance were positively related to dry arthropod biomass, with Burns and Isolates having the highest arthropod biomass. These patterns indicated that, 5–6 years post-burn, the patchy mosaic created by this wildfire supported more species than the mature forest surrounding the fire. Clear-cut logging prior to burning resulted in a diminished songbird community compared to that found in burned stands.",http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file_id=WF01050.pdf,Article,2002

There are a number of technologies now available for chemimechanical pulping of aspen, the two most popular being BCTMP and APMP. The former involves impregnation with alkaline sulphite (AS) and the latter with alkaline peroxide (AP) chemicals. Results from these two processes have been previously reported on aspen chips in terms of pulp property/energy requirements [1], and intrinsic relationships [2]. It is well understood that to reduce energy consumption in refiner mechanical pulping of aspen, some kind of alkali pre-treatment is needed [3]. Over the course of the last decade, the use of alkaline peroxide in the chip impregnation stage(s) has seen an increase in both development and commercial application. A large number of alkaline chip impregnation studies at atmospheric refining conditions, such as APMP and APP, have been conducted on hardwood species [2,4-7]. The large increase in hardwood utilization by the paper industry during the 1990s is one explanation for the rapid progression to commercial installation of a number of BCTMP and APMP (APP) mills for use in market pulp and/or integrated printing paper applications. The installed hardwood chemimechanical market pulp capacity increased from less than 10% in 1989 to 54% of capacity by 1999 [8].",http://www.pulpandpapercanada.com/news/mechanical-pulping-process-selection-for-chemimechanical-pulping-of-aspen/1000113612/?&er=NA,Article,2002

Inventory data from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Inventory Analysis Unit was used to develop estimates of the land area represented by the major overstory species at various age-classes. The CENTURY model was then used to develop an estimate of carbon dynamics throughout the age se- quence of forest development for the major ecosystem types. The estimated boreal forest area in Alaska, based on USFS inventory data is 17 244 098 ha. The total aboveground biomass within the Alaska boreal forest was estimated to be 815 330 000 Mg. The CENTURY model estimated maximum net ecosystem production (NEP) at 137, 88, 152, 99, and 65 g·m–2·year–1 for quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) forest stands, respectively. These values were predicted at stand ages of 80, 60, 41, 68, and 100 years, respec- tively. The minimum values of NEP for aspen, paper birch, balsam poplar, white spruce, and black spruce were –171, –166, –240, −300, and –61 g·m–2·year–1 at the ages of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 12, respectively. NEP became positive at the ages of 14, 19, 16, 13, and 34 for aspen, birch, balsam poplar, white spruce, and black spruce ecosystems, respectively. A 5°C increase in mean annual temperature resulted in a higher amount of predicted production and decomposition in all ecosystems, resulting in an increase of NEP. We estimate that the current vegetation absorbs approximately 9.65 Tg of carbon per year within the boreal forest of the state. If there is a 5°C increase in the mean annual temperature with no change in precipitation we estimated that NEP for the boreal forest in Alaska would increase to 16.95 Tg of carbon per year.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/x01-075,Article,2002

Careful preparation and processing of aspen ring samples can overcome these problems, yield accurate age and growth estimates, and concisely date disturbance events present in the tree-ring record. Proper collection of aspen wood is essential in obtaining usable ring data. Mounting of increment cores and sawn disk samples to wood backings holds samples rigid for easy surfacing. Sequential use of planers, belt sanders, and an assortment of sanding material on the surface of aspen core and disk samples can enhance visibility of tree rings.

We conducted a landscape-scale survey to assess aspen regeneration across gradients of wintering elk concentrations using 68 randomly selected aspen stands in the 1,090 km2 study area. Forty-four percent of the stands sampled supported regeneration of saplings (stems greater than 2 m in height but less than 10 cm in diameter). There were no significant differences of regeneration across elk winter range classification (p = 0.25) or distance from feedgrounds (p = 0.96).

Additionally, drumming logs were found close to clearings but in areas with increased amounts of undergrowth and mature trees. Adjacent habitat analysis (0.04-ha circular plot centered on logs) indicated drumming locations had significantly greater average canopy height, more vegetative cover consisting of conifer and total canopy cover, and more vertical foliage between 0.3 m and 3.0 m in height. Adjacent habitat was in advanced stages of maturity as indicated by significant numbers of both large-diameter logs and largediameter lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) snags.

General Land Office records from the 1800s indicate that aspen comprised a small fraction of the region’s eastern forests, but was more extensive on the western edge. Then Euro-American settlement in the 1800s brought land clearing, timber harvesting, and subsequent widespread wildfires that increased aspen-birch acreages consider- ably. Although aspen-birch acreage has declined since the 1930s, it remains the region’s second most prevalent forest type.

Selected isolates were tested for the ability to enhance aspen seedling growth in vitro. Over 50 species of ectomycorrhizal fungi occur with Populus tremuloides in this region, primarily basidiomycete fungi in the Agaricales. Almost one-third (30%) were ubiquitous with aspen and were found on all three soil types. Over one-third (37%) were restricted to the acidic, sandy soil of the smelter-impacted Butte-Anaconda area, revealing a subset of fungi that tolerate these conditions. Mycorrhizal fungi were screened for their ability to enhance aspen growth and establishment. Of nine selected isolates, all but one increased the biomass of aspen seedlings 2–4 times. Stem diameter, height, and number of root tips increased with inoculation of some fungi. The native species Paxillus vernalis, Tricholoma scalpturatum, Hebeloma mesophaem, Thelephora terrestris, and Laccaria spp. were most promising for further study.

To address this issue, we analyzed fire history patterns within the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, interior Alaska.

Fire return intervals based on tree ring data ranged from 37 to 166 years (mean = 90 􏰃 32 years; N = 38) over the 250 year time frame covered by this study. We found no significant differences in the frequency of fire occurence over time. There was no evidence to suggest that changes in fire management policy have significantly altered the fire regime in the Yukon Flats area. However, the lack of significant differences over time may be due in part to the relatively short time period that fires were actively suppressed in Alaska. The full suppression era (1939–1984) may have been too short to significantly alter the fire regime in all areas of interior Alaska.",blob:http://www.researchgate.net/e17c4b24-c9c7-4e18-973e-870641962bcd,Article,2001

Stem or petiole segments were tested for cavitation resistance before and after a controlled cavitation-refilling cycle. Cavitation was induced by centrifugation, air drying of shoots, or soil drought. Except for droughted plants, material was not significantly water stressed prior to collection. Cavitation resistance was determined from “vulnerability curves” showing the percentage loss of conductivity versus xylem pressure. Two responses were observed. “Resilient” xylem (Acer negundo and Alnus incana stems) showed no change in cavitation resistance after a cavitation-refilling cycle. In contrast, “weakened” xylem (Populus angustifolia, P. tremuloides, Helianthus annuus stems, and Aesculus hippocastanum petioles) showed considerable reduction in cavitation resistance. Weakening was observed whether cavitation was induced by centrifugation, air dehydration, or soil drought. Observations from H. annuus showed that weakening was proportional to the embolism induced by stress. Air injection experiments indicated that the weakened response was a result of an increase in the leakiness of the vascular system to air seeding. The increased air permeability in weakened xylem could result from rupture or loosening of the cellulosic mesh of interconduit pit membranes during the water stress and cavitation treatment.",http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/125/2/779.full.pdf+html,Article,2001

Healthy trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) trees, in old (>100 years) and mature (40–80 years) stands, were cut to provide three types of CWM: stumps, bolts on the ground (logs), and bolts suspended above the ground to simulate snags. Over 2 years, 1049 Coleoptera, represent- ing 49 taxa, were collected. Faunal structure differed little between the two locations. Species diversity was higher in old than in mature stands, and higher in stumps and logs than in suspended bolts; however, these “snags” tended to have higher abundance when compared with stumps and logs. Overall beetle abundance and the catch of wood-boring beetles was significantly higher in the first year post-treatment, mainly because of the ambrosia beetle (Trypodendron retusum (LeConte)) and one of its predators, Rhizophagus remotus LeConte; however, beetle diversity was higher in the second year, suggesting that early wood-boring species may “precondition” the wood for a number of succeeding spe- cies. The high turnover rate of taxa and spatial or temporal variation in faunal structure suggests that effort focused on habitat classification of CWM will facilitate management to conserve saproxylic faunal diversity.",http://www.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/bookstore_pdfs/18568.pdf,Article,2001

Hart,Where the Buffalo Roamed: or Did They?,Great Plains Research,11,1,83 - 102,Not found,"Grazing management on the Great Plains has been criticized for not more closely matching the presumed grazing patterns of bison. The critics assume that bison ""flash grazed,"" that is, grazed heavily for a short time, then moved on, and did not return for months or even years. This assumption complements the traditional view of an annual north-south migration of the herds. However, evidence from explorers' and other travelers' journals contradict both flash grazing and annual north-south migration. In a few cases where prolonged continu- ous observations were made in the same favorable habitat, bison were seldom absent. In Canada, bison sometimes moved from the plains into the bordering aspen parklands during severe winter weather, but not regularly and not north-south. Throughout the Great Plains, bison num- bers were so great and so thoroughly spread over the country that if a herd moved on, they were quickly replaced by another, giving little opportu- nity for rest or regrowth of the plant communities. Bison appeared to move in response to local conditions of forage availability, as influenced by weather, fire, and previous grazing. In at least one case, bison re- mained on a depleted watershed until they starved, rather than moving to an adjacent watershed with adequate forage.",http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1540&context=greatplainsresearch,Article,2001

Based on sequence similarity, they were grouped into two classes. Southern blots showed complex banding patterns and a high level of restriction fragment polymorphism between different aspen genotypes, suggesting that these trypsin inhibitors are members of a large, rapidly evolving gene family. One of the trypsin inhibitor genes, PtTI2, was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and its product shown to inhibit bovine trypsin in vitro. Both classes of PtTI genes are induced by wounding and herbivory, permitting rapid adaptive responses to herbivore pressure. The response appears to be mediated by an octadecanoid-based signaling pathway, as methyl jasmonate treatments induced the trypsin inhibitors. Wound-induced accumulation of trypsin inhibitor protein was also observed by western blot analysis. The pattern of expression, the apparent rapid evolution of TI genes, and the in vitro trypsin inhibitory activity are consistent with a role in herbivore defense. This work establishes the presence of a functional protein-based inducible defense system in trembling aspen.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1010654711619,Article,2001

It is also believed that burning will successfully regenerate aspen stands despite high elk numbers. To test this hypothesis, I evaluated 467 burned and 495 adjacent, unburned aspen stands at eight different locations within Jackson Hole. Aspen suckering was stimulated by burning, but most aspen stands still failed to produce new stems greater than 2 m tall where ungulate use was moderate or high. Only when elk use was low were burned aspen stands able to successfully regenerate. At those locations, however, unburned aspen stands also successfully regenerated.

Some authors have suggested that aspen is a marginal plant community in Yellowstone and that recent climatic variation has adversely affected aspen, while others contend that excessive browsing by native ungulates is primarily responsible for aspen’s widespread decline. To test these hypotheses, I measured all the long-term aspen exclosures (n = 14) in the Yellowstone Ecosystem. Aspen stands inside all exclosures successfully produced new stems greater than 2 m tall without fire or other disturbance, while few outside stands successfully regenerated due to repeated browsing. Understory species composition was also significantly different inside and outside exclosures. Protected aspen understories were dominated by tall, palatable shrubs and forbs, while grazed understories were dominated by exotic grasses and unpalatable, low-growing forbs. None of the enclosed aspen exhibited any signs of physiological stress, even on dry south-facing hillsides, an indication that climatic variation has not adversely impacted aspen. Instead, exclosure data suggest that aspen has declined throughout the Yellowstone Ecosystem due to repeated browsing by native ungulates, primarily elk.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1668&context=aspen_bib,Contribution to Book,2001

Our goal was to compare aspen age structure for elk winter range in the park with age structures developed for elk winter range in the national forests. We collected increment cores from aspen in three diameter size classes and three aspen habitat types (xeric, mesic, and scree). A special effort was made to collect increment cores from the relatively rare scree habitat type, since scree forms a ‘‘natural exclosure’’ where browsing pressure on aspen is reduced. The age structure of aspen in Yellowstone was significantly different from the age structures of aspen in either of the national forest areas (P<0:001). The Gallatin and Sunlight/Crandall age structures were not significantly different (P¼0:288). Only 6% of aspen stands in Yellowstone contained stems that originated from 1920 to 1989, while 87 and 84%  of  the  stands  in  the  Gallatin  and  Sunlight/Crandall  areas,  respectively,  contained  stems  from  that  period.  Within Yellowstone,  the  age  structure  of  aspen  in  the  scree  habitat  type  differed  significantly  from  the  mesic  and  xeric  sites  that were available for browsing (P<0:001). Aspen stems originating after 1920 dominated the scree stands, while trees originating between  1870  and  1920  dominated  the  non-scree  stands.  Aspen  stands  have  successfully  recruited  new  stems  into  their over stories in all habitat types from 1880 to 1989 in elk winter range on national forest areas surrounding the park. Within the park, aspen stands recruited new overstory stems between 1860 and 1929 in all habitat types. Since 1930, Yellowstone aspen have recruited overstory stems mostly in scree habitat type stands and other areas of reduced browsing pressure. We concluded that changes in ungulate browsing patterns due to differences in predation risk best explain the spatial and temporal pattern observed.",http://www.researchgate.net/publication/222828709_Aspen_age_structure_in_the_northern_Yellowstone_ecosystem_USA,Article,2001

We found that successful aspen overstory recruitment occurred on the northern range of YNP from the middle to late 1700s until the 1920s, after which it essentially ceased. We hypothesized why the browsing influence of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) may be different now than it was historically. At a landscape scale, elk hunting outside YNP may be a significant factor changing elk foraging behavior. At a finer scale, elk foraging patterns and behavior due to predation risk may have been altered with the removal of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) from YNP in the early 1900s. Wolves may positively influence aspen overstory recruitment through a trophic cascades effect by reducing elk populations and decreasing herbivory on aspen by modifying elk foraging patterns and behavior.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1666&context=aspen_bib,Contribution to Book,2001

We noted several important changes in the pattern of the landscape and the structure of the forests. The relative area covered by interspersed, nonforested rangelands has decreased significantly, and the total forest cover across these landscapes has increased. Statistical analyses (ANOVA) of other landscape characteristics (patch number and patch size distribution) did not detect changes. However, nonstatistical observation of the trends in these data revealed that in many cases, there has been important, observable change in the configuration of the landscape at many of these locations.

It is commonly accepted that there is mutual benefit to the partners, due to the exchange of plant-derived carbohydrates for amino acids and nutrients supplied by the fungus. While the major concepts of mycorrhizal functioning (exchange of nutrients and metabolites) were proposed in the 1960s, their verification at the molecular level started approximately 10 years ago. This review covers concepts at the molecular level concerned with the fungal carbohydrate supply in symbiosis. We discuss: strategies used by host plants to compensate (and perhaps restrict) carbohydrate drain to the fungal partner; fungal mechanisms that generate strong monosaccharide sinks in colonized plant roots (the formation of a strong carbohydrate sink is a prerequisite for efficient fungal carbohydrate support by the plant partner); and the impact of apoplastic hexose concentration on the regulation of fungal metabolism in symbiosis, since monosaccharides not only serve as nutrients but also as a signal that regulates gene expression.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2001.00141.x/epdf,Article,2001

They are a phantom by-product that something that covers so much of the western geography can be so unfamiliar. In this age of Internet and paper documents, they represent a strange way of recording history. Finding in the mountains a stately aspen with a name carved in 1900 is some- how more valuable and exciting than seeing that same name writ- ten on a piece of paper. The carvings provide the closest thing to a compressed auto- biography of sheepherders, who are one of the most forgotten social groups in American history. But during the development of the West, sheepherding was a major and critical industry.1 Many ranchers ran both cattle and sheep and they provided meat for the early mining camps throughout the West. People ate a lot more mutton than we perceive they did. Fred Fulstone, member of a pioneer Nevada ranching family, is convinced that the early miners could not have endured the harsh working conditions in the mines without the high quality protein of mutton.2 The Basques are the “Indians” of Europe, the original Europeans that we know of, and the likely descendants of the Paleolithic peoples who lived in the Pyrenees.3 We can say this for the following two reasons: 1) the Basques speak a language that is unrelated to any other on earth,4 and 2) their blood type shows the highest incidence of Rh-negative and lowest B-type in Europe.5 Clearly, they stand out as a unique group, and recent studies on human genes confirm that.6 After thousands of years, the Basques are still in their original homeland in the Pyrenees Mountains, straddling the modern nations of France and Spain, and are clinging fast to their own identity.7 Today, fewer than three million people live in the Basque country and about half a million are Euskaldunak (speakers of Euskara, the Basque language), which is how the Basques define and call themselves.",http://www.foresthistory.org/publications/fht/fhtspringfall2001/mallea.pdf,Article,2001

We evaluated genotype · environment effects on foliar chemistry and growth of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) by growing multiple aspen genotypes under variable conditions of light and soil nutrient availability in a common garden. Foliage was analyzed for levels of nitrogen, phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins. Bioassays of leaf quality were con- ducted with fourth-stadium gypsy moth (Lymantria dis- par) larvae. Results revealed strong effects of plant genotype, light availability and nutrient availability; the importance of each factor depended upon compound type. For example, tannin concentrations differed little among genotypes and across nutrient regimes under low light conditions, but markedly so under high light condi- tions. Phenolic glycoside concentrations, in contrast, were largely determined by genotype. Variation in phenolic glycoside concentrations among genotypes was the most important factor affecting gypsy moth perfor- mance. Gypsy moth biomass and development time were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with phenolic glycoside levels. Allocation to phenolic glyco- sides appeared to be costly in terms of growth, but only under resource-limiting conditions. Context-dependent trade-offs help to explain why costs of allocation to resistance are often difficult to demonstrate.",http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Lindroth/publication/7306491_Genotype_and_environment_determine_allocation_to_and_costs_of_resistance_in_quaking_aspen/links/02e7e53b08cfed24a2000000.pdf,Article,2001

In current practice, this involves mainly the use of hydrogen peroxide, especially when high brightness is targeted. The reactions of hydrogen peroxide bleaching, usually performed in alkaline medium, result in chromophore removal through lignin modification and/or solubilization, accompanying an inevitable removal of carbohydrates. The dissolution of lignin and carbohydrates occurs to varying extents that are determined by bleaching parameters, such as peroxide charge and alkalinity. Generally, high peroxide charge coupled with high alkalinity is essential to attaining high pulp brightness. However, this common bleaching practice causes the loss of a considerable amount of organic substances from pulp fibres, which effects the bleaching operation in many respects. For instance, removal of the materials is directly reflected in pulp yield and, in turn, becomes the source of a bleach plant's production of COD (i.e., chemical oxygen demand).",http://www.pulpandpapercanada.com/news/an-insight-into-the-behaviour-of-aspen-ctmp-in-peroxide-bleaching/1000146831/?&er=NA,Article,2001

Sur- prisingly, existing data are inadequate to allow a comprehensive evaluation of logging effects on biodiversity, composition, and productivity since appropriate comparisons of stands of similar ages and differing disturbance histories are rare. We addressed this issue using a study of 2000 plots in 80 southern boreal forest stands in northern Minnesota, USA, wherein we contrasted naturally regenerated aspen (Populus tremuloides), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and black spruce (Picea mariana) stands established following logging or the dominant natural disturbance, wildfire, for stands of two age classes (25–40 and 70–100 yr old). For young stands, those established postlogging had higher vascular plant diversity than those postwildfire. Otherwise, we found no evidence of differing species diversity (including canopy tree, shrub, herbaceous, and bryophyte species), composition, produc- tivity, or nitrogen cycling, in forest stands of comparable age and forest type that originated after logging compared to after wildfire. These variables, however, differed significantly among forest types, with aboveground net primary productivity and plant species diversity generally higher in aspen than jack pine stands, even when growing on comparable soils, and lowest in black spruce. Although there is evidence that logging has increased the proportional landscape dominance by aspen, a forest type with higher diversity, nutrient cycling, and productivity than other types, our evidence refutes the idea that disturbance by logging has diminished stand-scale productivity or plant diversity in comparison to the common natural disturbance, wildfire.",http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/0012-9658%282001%29082%5B2731%3AIOLFAF%5D2.0.CO%3B2,Article,2001

Proceedings of the 2001 National Silviculture Workshop,No.PNW-GTR-546,Not found,59 - 67,Not found,"Aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx. and P. grandidentata Michx.) provides wood products, watershed protection, and wildlife habitat for numerous game and non-game species across the northern Great Lakes region. Sustaining the productivity of these ecosystems requires maintaining soil productivity. Management activities that decrease soil porosity or remove organic matter can reduce productivity. We determined effects of three levels of soil compaction and organic matter removal (OMR) on aspen regeneration and growth following winter harvest of aspen-dominated stands in northern Minnesota, western Upper Michigan, and northern lower Michigan. Compaction treatments were applied to increase surface soil bulk density by either zero, 15, or 30 percent. The OMR treatments were merchantable bole harvest (MBH); total tree harvest (TTH); and total woody vegetation, plus forest floor removal (FFR). Soil compaction tended to increase mean sucker diameter and height on the sand and decrease them on the fine textured soils. Compaction greatly reduced sucker density and growth on the most productive silt-loam soil, primarily due to late spring treatment. These results apply to planning of operational harvest of aspen-dominated stands throughout the northern Great Lakes region. Sucker density increased with level of OMR on all three sites. On the sand site, mean diameter, height, and biomass were greatest with MBH and decreased significantly with increasing OMR, indicating a potential decline in productivity with repeated total tree harvesting on sand soils.",http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/gtr/gtr_pnwrs546_stone_002.pdf,Article,2001

A reserve shelterwood cut was applied to three additional stands to evaluate performance of white pine planted under 50% crown cover. After the first full growing season following harvest, 96% of the RTM harvested areas were stocked; sucker density averaged 27000 per acre versus 38.2 k per acre on a clearcut control, 41% greater. Basal diameter of dominant suckers averaged 0.45 inch, 28% greater than the control, and mean height was 60 inches, 33% greater. The control site had 3.1k stems per acre of associated commercial species versus 5.8 k on the RTM sites, an 87% difference. Four of the nine stands have been planted; first-year survival ranged from 75% to near 100%. The RTM shows promise for reducing sucker density, increasing their early growth, maintaining species diversity, and providing abundant regeneration of commercial species on a high proportion of the areas harvested.

Evapotranspiration is highly dependent upon the amount of precipitation.

We examined songbird communities in the boreal mixed-wood forest of Alberta, Canada, to investigate the effect on songbird abundance of (1) logging and (2) retaining variable densities of residual trees in cutblocks (10–133 trees/ha or basal area of 0.50–10.65 m2). We surveyed songbirds in logged and forested, aspen-dominated, mixed-wood stands in the year before, the year after, and three years after logging. We analyzed changes in abundance of 27 common songbird species: 23 present in the forest prior to logging and four that appeared after logging. Ten species declined with logging and were termed ‘‘forest species.’’ Ten more species did not change with logging and were called ‘‘habitat gener- alists.’’ The seven species that increased with logging were called ‘‘cutblock species.’’ When the effect of residual tree retention was examined in terms of basal area (rather than density) of residual trees, more songbird species were found to be both positively and negatively affected by residual tree retention, despite the fact that the two tree measures were highly correlated. In the first year after logging, four bird species (two forest, one generalist, and one cutblock) increased, and none decreased with increasing residual tree retention in cutblocks. In the third year after logging, again four species increased with increasing retention, but these were different species than in the first year after logging (one forest and three generalist species). Furthermore, four cutblock species decreased with increasing retention. Based on these findings, we conclude that retention of residual trees may be beneficial to some species, although conservation of unlogged reserves is also important. Most importantly, we recommend that research be continued to examine a larger range of tree retention and longer term effects on the avifauna.",http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/1051-0761%282001%29011%5B1656%3ARTRAST%5D2.0.CO%3B2,Article,2001

The reduced model is based on the widely used assumption that the relationship between height and age of dominant trees depends solely on site properties: i.e., four climatic variables (degree-days, vapor pressure deficit, aridity index, and precipitation), and one edaphic variable (soil water-holding capacity). The full model is based on the further assumption that site index also depends on the stand successional stage represented by the dbh distribution index. The reduced model is accurate and unbiased for both intolerant species, but it becomes inaccurate and underestimates the mature stand dominant height for both tolerant species. The full model is equivalent to the reduced model for both intolerant species, but becomes two or three times more accurate and unbiased for both tolerant species. When incorporated into a growth and yield model as the site quality index, the reduced model performs as well as the traditional phytometric model (derived solely from an empirical fit of dominant height and age without any biophysical data) for both intolerant species, but it becomes biased for both tolerant species. By contrast, the full model, when used as a site quality index in the growth and yield model, is unbiased and equivalent to the phytometric model for the four species. These results show that the site index of intolerant species can be solely associated with climatic and edaphic variables, but these variables have to be completed by the successional stage for correctly estimating the site index of the tolerant species.

Pellet group and browse utilization transects in the Canadian Rockies showed that elk were attracted to roads used by park visitors and avoided by wolves, and that elk possibly avoided aspen and conifer patches near backcountry trails used by wolves. In high predation risk landscapes, aspen stands were dense, lightly browsed, and rarely entered by elk. As risk decreased, elk density and aspen browsing increased proportionally faster on edges of aspen stands compared to the interior of aspen stands. In low risk landscapes, edge and interior plots were intensively used, and stands had a low density of heavily browsed stems. Regeneration of aspen stands likely requires low densities of risk-sensitive elk.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7912&context=aspen_bib,Contribution to Book,2001

Changes in forest cover were stratified by Ecological Subsection, management status, and by ownership categories using a 1995 digital ownership layer. Approximately 4.2% of the 1990 mature forested area was converted to early successional types by 1995. Of this 4.2%, private lands accounted for 33%, federal lands 31%, county lands 20% and state lands 16%. Notable conversion percentages by cover type category were spruce-fir (−5.3%), aspen-birch(−4.7%), jack pine (−4.6%) and black spruce(−3.0%). Transition rates were also adjusted to fit ten-year time intervals. Shannon-Weaver Eveness and edge density of cover types increased over the study period as relative contagion and interior forest area decreased. These trends suggest both smaller patches and a more even distribution of cover types. Area of upland conifers, lowland conifers and lowland hardwoods decreased while the area of mature upland hardwoods increased in most patch size classes except the > 500 ha class which showed a substantial decrease in area. The area of early successional types increased in most patch size classes. Non-industrial private forestland had the lowest proportion of interior forest of all ownership categories -decreasing by 13.5% in five years. Smaller average cut-unit size sand uncoordinated forest management is the likely cause since cutting rates between private and public forestland were similar.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1016522509857,Article,2001

The rooting percentage in vitrovaried from 62%-97% (42%-91% in ex vitro). For micropropagation, there were significant correlations between rooting percentage in vitro and ex vitro (r = 0.55**) and between multiplication rate and rooting percentage ex vitro (r = 0.49*).

The Aspen Parkland extends from northern Alberta, across Saskatchewan and southeast to southern Manitoba. The harvesting of grasses for hay in this vast area is usually limited to two cuts. With alfalfa and bromegrass mixtures, maximum production was obtained with a first cut in late June or early July and a second cut the third week in August (Bittman et al. 1991, Nuttall et al. 1991). Optimum precipitation and temperature conditions appear to favor a first cut in the latter part of June, but inadequate mois- ture results in a lower-yielding second cut the third or fourth week of August.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the composition and diversity of epiphytic lichen and bryophyte communities on trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), as a function of the time elapsed since stand initiation. The study was carried out in the forests surrounding Lake Duparquet, in the southwestern part of Québec's boreal forest. Stands representing different post-fire successional stages, corresponding to 278, 125, 79, and 51 yr since the last fire were selected. For each stand age, 10 trees from four different sites were sampled. A total of 75 species of non-vascular plants were found, including 34 species of mosses, seven species of liverworts, and 34 species of lichens. More species were observed in the 278-yr old stand, which also contained a greater number of exclusive species. In a correspondence analysis performed on species presence/absence data, axes one and two were correlated with distance from the closest unburnt area and time since fire. For each tree, species richness, diversity, and cover indices were calculated and compared for the different stand ages. These indices tended to be higher in the 79-yr old stand and lower in the 51-yr old stand. By using mixed log-linear models, we found that the frequency of occurrence of some species was linked to the time since fire, and others species to tree age. Old-growth forests are important to bryophytes and lichens since they have a greater number of species and some species are found exclusively or more frequently in old-growth forests. Furthermore, each stand age has some species associated with it. Therefore, forest management practices should be adopted to maintain all successional stages present in the natural forest landscape in order to preserve the diversity of non-vascular plants.",http://www.jstor.org/stable/info/3244336,Article,2000

A sediment core spanning the last 4000+ yrs from Pine Lake was analyzed for charcoal, granulometry, grain roundness, tephra content, geochemistry, mineralogy and pollen. This multi-proxy record indicates: (1) increasing anoxia causing a shift in S deposition from gypsum to pyrite due to increasing moisture availability in the late Holocene; (2) a decrease in Mg flux into the lake due to the development of the aspen forest, which reduced water flow through the Mg-rich shallow sand aquifer; the aspen forest expansion was in turn induced by the extirpation of plains bison prior to settlement; and (3) a change in the upland fire regime from frequent low-biomass grass fires to less frequent but higher biomass under-story fires, also as a result of the expansion of the aspen forest. Not only are the different proxies sensitive to different rates and magnitudes of change, they also show different sensitivities to different types of hydrological change: the mineralogy and geochemistry are sensitive to changes in water level and redox potential, and to changes in the relative strengths of the aquifers feeding the lake, while the granulometry is sensitive to total hydrological balance.

Natural mortality (i.e., from coyotes [Canus latrans], dogs, malnutrition, sickness, and unknown causes) (n=44, 71%) was the primary cause of female mortality, followed by harvest (n=14, 22.6%) and accidental causes (i.e., road kill and drowning) (n=4, 6.5%). More females died in spring (n=33, 53.2%) than in fall (n=14, 22.6%), winter (n=9, 14.5%), or summer (n=6, 9.7%). For the entire study period (1993-1996), survival rate for female white-tailed deer was 10.4%. Annual survival rates of females ranged from 50.3 to 62.1% and were similar among years (P=0.743). Intraseasonal survival rates for females differed between winter (P=0.003) and spring (P=0.014), whereas summer (P=0.073) and fall (P=0.404) were similar. High spring mortalityof females was related to poor forage conditions on winter range and limited escape cover throughout the central Black Hills. We recommend the use of management techniques that promote overstory and understory plant diversity, such as aspen (Populus tremuloides) regeneration and prescribed burns, to improve the habitat in this region.",http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_DePerno/publication/30068916_Female_Survival_Rates_in_a_Declining_White-Tailed_Deer_Population/links/00463525e9805b6533000000.pdf,Article,Winter 2000

Throughout the inland West and particularly in the Southwest, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed conifer forests have become dense and structurally homogeneous after periods of intense livestock grazing, followed by more than 100 years of fire suppression. Prior to the late 1800s, pine-dominated forests at Grand Canyon National Park were structurally diverse, averaging 45 to 90 trees per acre, with frequent, low-intensity fires burning across the landscape every 7 to 11 years. Today, much of the historic landscape heterogeneity has been replaced by dense, contiguous stands averaging 600 to 900 trees per acre. The beneficial reintroduction of fire to these areas is difficult and often results in fire effects that are uncharacteristic of those produced by historic fire regimes. In response, park managers have called for the exploration of restoration approaches using combinations of prescribed fire and understory thinning. The goal of this approach is to achieve more natural and sustainable forest structures while conserving the most fragile elements of the exist- ing ecosystem such as old-growth trees and native herbaceous communities. This paper describes the approach, rationale and preliminary results of a project designed to examine the utility and ecological effects of three, small-scale restoration experiments on a suite of forest structure attributes.",http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_p015_5/rmrs_p015_5_249_254.pdf,Contribution to Book,2000

The four species were found on a number of tree and shrub species, especially willow, cottonwood, oak, alder, aspen, poplar, and bitterbrush. The four predators differed in degree of specialization. A. whitei was found almost exclusively on antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata Pursh), apparently in close association with an unidentiÞed psyllid. The other two anthocorids were more generalized, but differed in occurrence on some tree species. Adult and immature A. antevolens were common on oak, cottonwood, and poplar. Conversely, A. tomentosus was comparatively uncommon on these species, but was more abundant than A. antevolens on the neighboring willows; immatures of A. tomentosus were never recovered from oak. Adult and immature D. brevis were collected from several species not shown to support populations of Anthocoris spp., suggesting that the mirid is more of a generalist than the anthocorids. Anthocoris spp. were rare in apple orchards, whereas D. brevis was common there. A. tomentosus and A. antevolens showed distinct seasonal changes in plant use. Both species congregated on willow catkins beginning in March, but began to appear on summer hosts (oak, cottonwood, alder, aspen, poplar) in May and June. Some of the movement from willow may have been a result of the disappearance of a univoltine psyllid from this host plant. Traps composed of corrugated cardboard were placed at different sites to collect overwintering predators. A. antevolens and D. brevis were more broadly distributed among plant species than A. tomentosus or A. whitei (the latter restricted to pear and bitterbrush). A. antevolens was very abundant in traps collected from poplar and cottonwood, apparently because both tree species are important sources of late-summer prey for this predator. Other miscellaneous Anthocoridae and Deraeocoris spp. were collected while sampling, and lists of these species are provided. Orius tristicolor (White) was common at several sites, and was easily the most abundant anthocorid in overwintering traps at one intensively sampled orchard.

(Betulaceae), bigleaf maple, Acer macrophyllum Pursh (Aceraceae), red alder, Alnus rubra Bong. (Betulaceae), and Sitka alder, A. viridis ssp. sinuata (Regel) Á. Löve & D. Löve (Betulaceae). Utilising coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection analysis, the captured volatiles were assayed for antennal responses in five species of coniferophagous bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), sympatric with most or all of the angiosperm trees: the Douglas-fir beetle, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins, the mountain pine beetle, D. ponderosae Hopkins, the spruce beetle, D. rufipennis (Kirby), the western balsam bark beetle, Dryocoetes confusus Swaine, and the pine engraver, Ips pini (Say). The identities of 25 antennally-active compounds were determined by coupled gas chromatographic-mass spectroscopic analysis, and co-chromatographic comparisons with authentic chemicals. The compounds identified were: hexanal, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, 1-hexanol, heptanal, α-pinene, frontalin, benzaldehyde, β-pinene, 2-hydroxycyclohexanone, 3-carene, limonene, β-phellandrene, benzyl alcohol, (E)-ocimene, salicylaldehyde, conophthorin, guaiacol, nonanal, methyl salicylate, 4-allylanisole, decanal, thymol methyl ether, (E)-nerolidol, and dendrolasin. A number of these compounds are known semiochemicals that are active in the behaviour of other organisms, including bark beetles, suggesting a high degree of semiochemical parsimony. Antennally-active compounds ranged from seven in A. viridis to 17 in P. trichocarpa. The fewest number of compounds (9) were detected by I. pini and the largest number (24) were detected by D. pseudotsugae. Six compounds excited the antennae of all five species of bark beetles. The large number of antennally-active compounds detected in common by numerous bark beetles and present in common in numerous nonhost trees supports the hypothesis of olfaction-based recognition and avoidance of nonhost angiosperm trees during the process of host selection by coniferophagous bark beetles.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FPL00001811,Article,2000

In turn, these soils have an important role in many physical, chemical, and biological processes (Van Cleve et al. 1986). In combination with the slope, aspect, elevation, and composition of the underlying mineral soil profile of a specific site (Swanson 1996), organic soils are particularly influential in regulating ground temperature and moisture. As a general rule, the presence of a deep organic soil layer serves to insulate the forest floor during the growing season, causing colder temperatures than would otherwise occur. In many forested sites, autogenic cooling resulting from deepening organic soil layers eventually leads to the formation of permafrost, which, in turn, impedes drainage and substantially increases soil moisture (Van Cleve and Viereck 1981; Van Cleve et al. 1983a, b).",http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-0-387-21629-4_12,Contribution to Book,2000

Kay,Native Burning in Western North America: Implications for Hardwood Forest Management,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,"It is now widely acknowledged that frequent low-intensity fires once structured many western forests. What is not generally recognized, however, is that most of those fires were purposefully set by native people, not started by lightning. Data from the Rocky Mountains attest to the widespread use of fire by native people, as does the ecology of aspen, the only common deciduous hardwood in the West. Fire history studies all show that aspen once burned at frequent intervals, yet aspen will readily burn only when the trees are leafless and the understory dry — conditions which occur only early in the spring before leaf-out and understory regrowth, or late in the fall after leaf-drop and the understory has been killed by frost. During both these periods, though, there are few lightning strikes and virtually no lightning- started fires in the Rocky Mountains. Thus if aspen burned frequently in the past, as all evidence indicates it once did, then those fires must have been started by native people, who used fire to modify plant communities for human benefit. Similarly, eastern deciduous forests will readily burn only when leafless, but during that time there are few lightning strikes — one of many indications that aboriginal burning was also common in the eastern U.S.",http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/newtown_square/publications/technical_reports/pdfs/2000/274%20papers/kay274.pdf,Contribution to Book,2000

Land management agencies in the West are currently developing methods to assess and monitor riparian community condition to adapt land use practices that would better protect rangeland ecosystems. To determine whether these methods also provide an indication of abiotic and biotic stream condition, we compared the classification system of riparian communities developed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to physical parameters of stream condition and to aquatic invertebrate community assemblages. Thirty-three sites in 19 different streams of the Toiyabe Range in central Nevada were measured for water quality, substrate characteristics, and fish abundance and diversity. We sampled aquatic invertebrates and calculated community indices based on environmental tolerance levels, taxonomic diversity, and abundance of sensitive taxa. USFS personnel classified these sites by dominant riparian plant community type (meadow, willow, or aspen) and ecological status (low, moderate, or high) using plant abundance data, rooting depth, and soil infiltration to determine similarities to potential natural communities.",https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/wnan/article/view/28135,Article,2000

We analysed long-term, daily surface meteorological records for 13 sites in Alaska and north-western Canada and an 82-y record of river ice breakup date for the Tanana River in interior Alaska. We found increases in winter and spring temperature extrema for all sites, with the greatest increases in spring minimum temperature, average 0.47 °C per 10 y, and a 0.7- day per 10 y advance in ice breakup on the Tanana River. We used the climate records to drive an ecosystem process model, BIOME_BGC, to simulate the effects of climate change on the carbon and water balances of boreal forest ecosystems. The growing season has lengthened by an average of 2.6days per 10y with an advance in average leaf onset date of 1.10days per 10y. This advance in the start of the active growing season correlates positively with progressively earlier ice breakup on the Tanana River in interior Alaska. The advance in the start of the growing season resulted in a 20% increase in net primary production for both aspen (Populus tremuloides) and white spruce (Picea glauca) stands.

In the boreal mixedwood, successional trajectories exhibit significant variability, thereby making classification systems based on age or seral stage difficult to apply. Furthermore, a lack of extensive datasets on forest structure prevents comprehensive, multivariate classification of stands. Alternatively, we designated old growth status using the proportion (≥15%) of large trees (≥40 cm DBH) and the subcanopy/canopy tree ratios (>1.5). With these riteria, approximately 11.4% of the boreal mixedwood landbase within northeastern Alberta has an old growth structure. Proportionally, more old growth structure was found in aspen and white spruce mixedwood types, with lesser proportions in pure aspen and white spruce stands. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the tree size criteria was the most important driving variable in determining the amount of old growth.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112799001656,Article,2000

The refuge is charged with protecting, enhancing, and restoring populations and habitats of all the species found on its grounds. Since its inception, however, management has focused on elk. Supplemental feeding has supported higher numbers of elk than the refuge ecosystem can handle, and it has long been recognized that the large concentration of these ungulates has had negative impacts on a number of biotic communities. Elk have reduced and eliminated woody tree and shrub cover along riparian areas, limited aspen regeneration, reduced sage-grassland structural diversity, and rendered areas prone to exotic plant invasion. If current management continues, these vegetative communities and their associated wildlife species will continue to decline. This paper recommends that the refuge needs: (1) to define its commitment to the protection of biodiversity before it can manage biodiversity more sustainably; (2) to manage on a regional level and coordinate with other agencies and private landowners; (3) to establish a comprehensive monitoring and data analysis program to determine if management prescriptions are successful and to adapt management to changing information and conditions; (4) to reduce supplemental feeding and the size of the elk herd; (5) to take measures to restore degraded communities; and (6) to build a constituency for biodiversity.

While O3 levels are increasing in the atmosphere, in fact none of it has been detected inside the leaf (LAISK et al. 1989). Ozone readily reacts with water giving rise to reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide and super- oxide anion radical (GRIMES et al. 1983; KANOFSKY & SIMA 1995). ROS and especially radicals can non- specifically react with lipids, pro teins and nuc leic acids (DAVIES 1995) thus disrupting the structural and func- tional integrity of the cell. W hile the increased rise in tropospheric O3 and the resulting increase in ROS is the result of human activities, the active oxygen species are also produced naturally during the normal metabolism of photosynthesizing cells. All green plants as well as other aerobic organisms have evolved antioxidant defense systems to combat the inevitable ROS (ALSCH- ER et al. 1997). The antioxidant systems can be enzy- matic or non-enzymaticROS scavengers that require the activation of specific metabolic pathways and invest- ment of energy. It has been shown that plants growing under the conditions of oxidative stress have elevated levels of antioxidants (Rao et al. 1996; POLLE 1997; NOCTOR & FOYER 1998). The principle of the action of the antioxidants is simple, but the mechanism of regula- tion of their synthesis and activity is not well estab- lished. An aspect of doubt is whether antioxidants can provideprotection against briefhigh-O3 episodes orare they useful for protecting plants from only long-term chronic exposure. In current experiment we subjected two aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) clones, differ- ing in O3 tolerance, to acute O3 episodes of up to six hours to test the inducibility of the enzymes of the Halliwell-Asada antioxidant pathway (Fig. 1) and catalase, the major scavenger of high levels of hydrogen peroxid e.",http://aspenface.mtu.edu/pdfs/Noormets%20Rapid%20response%20of%20antioxidant%202000.pdf,Article,2000

Thawing destroys the physical foundation (ice-rich soil) on which boreal forest ecosystems rest causing dramatic changes in the ecosystem. Impacts on the forest depend primarily on the type and amount of ice present in the permafrost and on drainage conditions. At sites generally underlain by ice-rich permafrost, forest ecosystems can be completely destroyed. In the Mentasta Pass area, wet sedge meadows, bogs, thermokarst ponds, and Iakes are replacing forests. An upland thermokarst site on the University of Alaska Campus consists of polygonal pattern of troughs and pits caused by thawing ice-wedge polygons. Trees are destroyed in corresponding patterns. In the Tanana Flats, ice rich permafrost supporting birch forests is thawing rapidly and the forests are being converted to minerotrophic floating mat fens. At this site, an estimated 83% of 2.6*10^5 ha was underlain by permafrost a century or more ago. About 42% of this permafrost has been influenced by thermokarst development within the last 1 to 2 centuries. Thaw subsidence at the above sites is typically 1 to 2 m with some values up to 6 m. Much of the discontinuous permafrost in Alaska is extremely warm, usually within 1 or 2 degrees C of thawing, and highly susceptible to thermal degradation.

While these physiological responses have commonly been measured at the leaf level, in small seedlings, and integrated in fluxes of whole stands or watersheds, sap flux measure- ments in large trees have become a useful tool for monitoring transpiration of individual canopies over long time periods. In this study, sap flux (JS) was measured with constant heat sap flow gauges for co-occurring species which have been previously evaluated at the leaf level. Measurements were taken in a subalpine stand containing most of the dominant species of the central Rocky Mountains (Pinus contorta, Abies lasiocarpa, Populus tre- muloides, and Pinus flexilis). Daily JS values were parabolically related to daytime average atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D) in all species, with a broad range of maximum JS values occurring between 1.2 and 1.8 kPa. Populus tremuloides had the greatest increases in JS with increasing D, while Pinus contorta showed the lowest JS. A decrease in maximum JS was observed for all species later in the season when soil moisture declined from 0.35 to 0.24 m3/m3 at 0–45 cm. Late-season JS in A. lasiocarpa decreased 50% due to stomatal closure in response to the soil moisture deficit, regardless of daily D. In contrast, the Pinus species were sensitive to D, showing larger late-season reductions in JS on high than on low D days. Populus tremuloides showed less sensitivity to soil moisture than the other species, with relatively high JS continuing late into the season and intermediate change in the response of JS to D with decreasing soil moisture. Stand-level estimates of transpiration by plots dominated by Pinus contorta and A. lasiocarpa (2.6 􏰈 0.6 mm/d) were found to be similar to plots dominated by Populus tremuloides (2.7 􏰈 0.6 mm/d) despite the nearly fourfold higher leaf area indices for the conifers.",http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081%5B2557%3ASFOCOS%5D2.0.CO%3B2,Article,2000

Two experimental systems constituted of plants or detached leaves of cuttings of Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides cv. Muhs 1 were submitted to chilling (4 °C) and control (23 °C) conditions. During 4 days, sampling was realised. The first step of the work consisted in the observation of the effects of chilling on stress indicators, i.e. chlorophyll fluorescence as well as chlorophyll content. Chlorophyll fluorescence indicated that the plants were stressed. Similarly, increasing sucrose and glucose levels as well as enhanced sucrose metabolism in the plants subjected to chilling stress were recorded. The comparison of the proteome of leaves under both conditions revealed the presence of two families of proteins in stressed plants.",http://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?session=8170,Contribution to Book,2000

It has been suggested that isoprene improves thermotolerance by helping photosynthesis cope with high temperature. However, the evidence for the thermotolerance hypothesis is indirect and one of three methods used to support this hypothesis has recently been called into question. More direct evidence required new methods of controlling endoge- nous isoprene. An inhibitor of the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate pathway, the alternative pathway to the mevalonic acid pathway and the pathway by which isoprene is made, is now available. Fosmidomycin eliminates isoprene emission without affecting photosynthesis for several hours after feeding to detached leaves. Photosynthesis of fosmidomycin-fed leaves recovered less following a 2-min high-temperature treatment at 46°C than did photosynthesis of leaves fed water or fosmidomycin-fed leaves in air supplemented with isoprene. Photosynthesis of Phaseolus vulgaris leaves, which do not make isoprene, exhibited increased thermotolerance when isoprene was supplied in the airstream flowing over the leaf. Other short-chain alkenes also improved thermotolerance, whereas alkanes reduced thermotolerance. It is concluded that ther- motolerance of photosynthesis is a substantial benefit to plants that make isoprene and that this benefit explains why plants make isoprene. The effect may be a general hydrocarbon effect and related to the double bonds in the isoprene molecule.",http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/125/4/2001.full.pdf+html,Article,2000

We have also identified homologous ESTs in rice, cotton, maize, poplar, pine tree and the ice plant. We do not observe animal homologues, suggesting that this subfamily could be specific for plants. Our data suggest an important role for these proteins.

The best nine and (GT) (GA) microsatellite markers were tested on a set of 23 P. nigra genotypes from all over Europe. The microsatellites were highly polymorphic, with 10–19 different alleles per microsatellite locus among these 23 genotypes. WPMS08 sometimes amplified three fragments. Using the other eight marker loci, the level of heterozygosity among the plants was on average 0.71 (range 0.25–1.00).

Pouzar as a biocontrol agent for several weedy deciduous species. In this study, C. purpureum infection of cut stumps was surveyed 4 months following applications of the biocontrol agent in New Brunswick and Ontario field trials. The use of diagnostic molecular genetic markers to detect and identify C. purpureum was compared with morphological identification methods. Samples of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) from the New Brunswick trials confirmed infection with the biocontrol isolates of C. purpureum, and no cross contamination of treatment applications was detected. Analyses of recovered fungal samples from aspen and speckled alder (Alnus rugosa (Du Roi) Spreng.) in Ontario also confirmed the success of biocontrol infection. The percentage of C. purpureum infected stumps differed between hosts in the Ontario trials. An average of 84% of speckled alder stems and 54% of aspen stems were estimated to have been infected by the applied isolates of C. purpureum. Given a sufficient number of samples, this methodology can provide an early indication of successful stump infection by C. purpureum, a prerequisite for effective weed biocontrol.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/x99-137,Contribution to Book,1999

Canadian Geophysical Union - Hydrology Section.,Not found,16,2549 - 2562,Not found,"Two subarctic forested slopes in central Wolf Creek basin, Yukon, were studied in 1996–1997 to determine the seasonal pattern of the hydrologic processes. A south-facing slope has a dense aspen forest on silty soils with seasonal frost only and a north-facing slope has open stands of black spruce and an organic layer on top of clay sediments with permafrost. Snowmelt is advanced by approximately one month on the south-facing slope due to greater radiation receipt. Meltwater infiltrates its seasonally frozen soil with low ice content, recharging the soil moisture reservoir but yielding no lateral surface or subsurface flow. Summer evaporation depletes this recharged moisture and any additional rainfall input, at the expense of surface or subsurface flow. The north-facing slope with an ice rich substrate hinders deep percolation. Snow meltwater is impounded within the organic layer to produce surface runoff in rills and gullies, and subsurface flow along pipes and within the matrix of the organic soil. During the summer, most subsurface flows are confined to the organic layer which has hydraulic conductivities orders of magnitudes larger than the underlying boulder-clay. Evaporation on the north-facing slope declines as both the frost table and the water table descend in the summer. A water balance of the two slopes demonstrates that vertical processes of infiltration and evaporation dominate moisture exchanges on the south-facing slope, whereas the retardation of deep drainage by frost and by clayey soil on the permafrost slope promotes a strong lateral flow component, principally within the organic layer. These results have the important implication that permafrost slopes and organic horizons are the principal controls on streamflow generation in subarctic catchments.

In this paper we present results of radiometric and geometric analysis of the CASI data for developing algorithms for retrieving leaf area index (LAI) and crown closure of the boreal forest. The images of over 30 sites, composed of black spruce, jack pine, and aspen stands, were acquired on different days and locations with various solar illumination and view geometries. The geometrical-optical model, named “4-Scale” [Chen and Leblanc, 1997, 1316–1337], was used to correct the images to a common solar zenith angle (35°) and a common view angle (nadir). The 4-Scale model is also used for radiometric analysis based on spectral signatures of leaves and the background (moss, grass, and soil) acquired using various field and laboratory techniques. The red reflectance of all three cover types decreased with increasing LAI as expected. Similar but weaker decreasing trends were found in the near-infrared (NIR) band for conifer stands in contrast to previous findings for cropland and grassland. No significant NIR response to LAI was found for aspen stands. It is shown from 4-Scale that as LAI increases, the crown and ground shadow fractions of conifer forests increase, while the sunlit background fraction decreases and the sunlit crown fraction increases. The large change in the shadow fractions is the major factor controlling the behavior of red and NIR signals. Since boreal forests have abundant green moss and understory as the background, there is only a small difference in optical properties between the overstory and the background. The increases in the shadow fractions with LAI help strengthen the response of optical measurements to changes in LAI, providing a key mechanism for remote information retrieval. The implications of these findings on formulating/selecting vegetation indices and inversion models are discussed in this paper. Relationships of crown closure with CASI measurements are also included in the analysis.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1999JD900098/abstract,Article,1999

Beavers fed preferentially on a small number of deciduous species and the number of cut stems declined sharply with increasing distance from ponds. The maximum stem diameter cut was 45.3 cm, and the average stem diameter cut was 15.1 cm. Conifers increased in relative dominance to deciduous species in the presence of beavers. Plant species richness, and stem and basal area diversity peaked at intermediate distances (ca. 25 m) from ponds. Sapling recruitment by non-preferred species was positively related to foraging pressure. Total stem abundance and basal area and sapling recruitment by four preferred species (trembling aspen, red maple, sugar maple and beaked hazel) were negatively related to foraging pressure. However, by including alder and willow (also preferred by beavers) these patterns changed, becoming positively related to foraging pressure. Diversity patterns changed three years after abandonment. However, sapling recruitment patterns in preferred and non-preferred species around the abandoned pond were similar to the occupied ponds. Hence, selective foraging by beavers does not completely shift the community structure towards non-preferred species. These observations suggest that beavers do not act as keystone species, i.e., they increase the importance of the dominant plant species (conifers). However, the gaps they create facilitate the regeneration of stems of both their preferred food species and non-preferred species, with future ramifications to forest structure.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112798004873,Article,1999

Greenhouse inoculation of ramets derived from the same five clones resulted in the same resistance rankings as main-stem inoculations in the field. One isolate, Hm-27, produced longer cankers, and less callus developed on all clones compared with trees inoculated with the less aggressive strain, Hm-24. Cankers developed only on clones that were inoculated during the months of April through July with April inoculations resulting in the largest cankers. These results indicate that there is a limited time frame when wounds on aspen are susceptible to infection by artificial inoculation with the pathogen as many wound inoculations neither produced cankers nor wound callus. Comparing inoculation methods, either main-stem inoculations in the field or greenhouse inoculations coupled with the natural canker prevalence could be used to include or exclude clones for use in an aspen breeding program.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/x99-062,Article,1999

We analyzed the NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) backscatter from September 1996 to June 1997, along with temperature and snow depth observations and ecosystem modeling, for three BOREAS sites in central Canada. Because of its short wavelength (2.14 cm), NSCAT was sensitive to canopy and surface water. NSCAT had 25 km spatial resolution and approximately twice-daily temporal coverage at the BOREAS latitude. At the northern site the NSCAT signal showed strong seasonality, with backscatter around −8 dB in winter and −12 dB in early summer and fall. The NSCAT signal for the southern sites had less seasonality. At all three sites there was a strong decrease in backscatter during spring thaw (4–6 dB). At the southern deciduous site, NSCAT backscatter rose from −11 to −9.2 dB during spring leaf-out.

A further objective was to establish an annual budget of isoprene emitted from a remote boreal forest and thus assess uncertainties associated with seasonal isoprene emission inventories. The onset of isoprene emissions occurred two weeks after the forest attained its maximum leaf area. Scaled to the foliage level, averaged isoprene fluxes approached 10 􏰌 5 nmol m􏰉2 s􏰉1 in the spring. During the middle of the growing season averaged isoprene emissions amounted to 28 􏰌 4 nmol m􏰉2 s􏰉1, whereas late summer values reached 16 􏰌 2 mmol m􏰉2 s􏰉1. These isoprene capacities were normalized to 25􏰍C and photosynthetically active radiation of 1000 􏰖mol m􏰉2 s􏰉1. Given the strong seasonality observed in isoprene emissions, the authors propose to include seasonally adjusted emission rates to derive isoprene inventories for the entire foliage growing cycle. With an active biomass of 144 g m􏰉2, using a seasonally adjusted emission rate in a one-dimensional multilayered model it is estimated that during 1994 the boreal aspen forest emitted 32 􏰖mol of isoprene per square meter. Such isoprene source strength represented approximately 1% of the photosynthetically fixed carbon by the aspen forest. In addition to the seasonal controls dictated by the inherent plant metabolic activity, low temperatures (􏰅10􏰍C) strongly reduced the amplitude of diurnal isoprene emissions.",http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0450%281999%29038%3C0855%3ASVIIEF%3E2.0.CO%3B2,Contribution to Book,1999

Calcareous organic-matter-rich Black Chernozemic soils often persist under poplar forests in Saskatchewan, not acquiring the Ae horizons and related properties more characteristic of Gray Luvisol soils. These are Rego Black Chernozems, locally termed “Wooded Calcareous” because of the occurrence of a dark, calcareous horizon (AC) at depths of 10 to 30 cm. We hypothesize that dark, calcareous horizons are former Bm horizons that have been recarbonated because of intense bio- cycling of Ca by aspen (Populus tremuloides). The comparatively small amounts of carbonate occur mainly in the fine silt and clay fractions, and are dominantly calcite, indicating secondary origin, in comparison to the carbonate minerals of the Ck horizons where both calcite and dolomite occur, the latter more common in coarse fractions. The δ13C values of the carbonate minerals indi- cate that virtually all the carbonate in fine fractions of the upper horizons of the Wooded Calcareous soil is pedogenic. The dom- inance of pedogenic carbonate in the Ahk and AC horizons of the Wooded Calcareous soil is consistent with a secondary enrichment, a probable result of increased biocycling of Ca where aspen grows on sites with large amounts of soluble Ca in the subsoil. High concentrations of soluble Ca2+ and SO 2– in the LFH of the Wooded Calcareous are consistent with increasing biocycling of these ions, from a gypsum-rich subsoil.",http://pubs.aic.ca/doi/pdf/10.4141/S98-006,Article,1999

To resolve this uncertainty, net C exchange has been measured at several sites in the boreal forest of Canada as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). One of these sites is the Southern Old Aspen site at which diurnal CO2 and energy (radiation, latent, and sensible heat) fluxes were measured during 1994 using eddy correlation techniques at different positions within a mixed 70 year old aspen-hazelnut forest. These measurements were used to test a complex ecosystem model “ecosys” in which mass and energy exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere are simulated hourly under diverse conditions of soil, management, and climate. These simulations explained between 70% and 80% of diurnal variation in ecosystem CO2 and energy fluxes measured during three 1 week intervals in late April, early June, and mid-July. Total annual CO2 fluxes indicated that during 1994, aspen was a net sink of 540 (modeled) versus 670 (measured) g C m−2 yr−1, while hazelnut plus soil were a net source of 472 (modeled) versus 540 (measured) g C m−2 yr−1. The aspen-hazelnut forest at the BOREAS site was therefore estimated to be a net sink of about 68 (modeled) versus 130 (measured) g C m−2 yr−1 during 1994. Long-term simulations indicated that this sink may be larger during cooler years and smaller during warmer years because C fixation in the model was less sensitive to temperature than respiration. These simulations also indicated that the magnitude of this sink declines with forest age because respiration increases with respect to fixation as standing phytomass grows. Confidence in the predictive capabilities of ecosystem models at decadal or centennial timescales is improved by well-constrained tests of these models at hourly timescales.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1998JD200117/full,Article,1999

Cover and height of all species on randomly located subplots within 0.05- to 0.075-ha treatment plots were used to develop indices of volume, structural diversity, and species diversity; to ordinate the plots; and to correlate species diversity with crop-tree performance. At both sites, community response was strongly influenced by the severity of site preparation. On a boreal site dominated by willow (Salix L. spp.), green alder (Alnus crispa (Ait.) Pursh ssp. crispa) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), site preparation increased structural diversity and had little effect on species diversity. High-severity treatments increased non-native species abundance 10- to 16-fold while only marginally enhancing growth of planted white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) over medium-severity treatments. On a nutrient-poor sub-boreal site, species diversity declined with increasing treatment severity and with increasing lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.) stem volume. Velvet-leaved blueberry (Vaccinium myrtilloides Michx.) was highly sensitive to mechanical disturbance. Moderate mechanical treatments appear to improve conifer performance while causing little change to plant communities, but high severity treatments can cause substantial change.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/x99-057,Contribution to Book,1999

Treatments consisted of two formulations (BC, ON) in combination with two fungal isolates (2139, JAM6), blank formulations, cutting only, triclopyr herbicide application, and an uncut control. Analysis of Sitka alder clump mortality indicated isolates JAM6 and 2139 in combination with the BC formulation caused clump mortality of 90 and 88%, respectively. The blank formulation treatments caused the lowest clump mortality and appeared to promote sprouting and growth of Sitka alder when compared with cutting alone. At the aspen installation, the BC formulation with isolate 2139 was found to be the most effective fungal treatment resulting in 84% aspen stem mortality. The results from both installations suggest that C. purpureum efficacy appears to be dependent on the virulence of the isolate and the formulation.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/x99-121,Contribution to Book,1999

Tree-ring analysis was conducted on a total of 138 aspen in pure and mixed 50--75-year-old stands, including stands showing heavy decline (more than 40% crown dieback). Past survey records and the pres­ ence of light-colored (white) growth rings indicated that stands in the study area were severely defoliated by forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hbn.) in 1962-1964 and several years during the period 1979-1990. Regression modeling showed that insect defoliation was the most important factor causing reduced growth in stem basal area, but drought also had a Significant influence. During periods with defoliation, stem growth was often reduced to less than 10% of that recorded during the most favorable periods. In the early 1990s, stem growth had recovered in all stands except those in the heavy decline class; however, a late winter thaw followed by severe frost in April 1992 caused a temporary reduction in stem growth and might have contributed to the observed dieback. Long-term productivity of aspen stands in this region will likely depend strongly on the future dynamics of forest tent caterpillar and the incidence of extreme climatic events. Crown dieback is expected to occur when drought occurs in combination with several consecutive years of defoliation.",http://www.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/bookstore_pdfs/11802.pdf,Book,1999

The hydrolyzates were prepared by dilute-acid hydrolysis of wood from pine, aspen, birch, and spruce. The volatile emission from the hydrolyzates before fermentation was measured, and the sensor array response pattern was compared with the observed fermentability of the hydrolyzates, i.e. with the final ethanol concentration after fermentation and the maximum specific ethanol production rate. Two concentration parameters in the hydrolyzates, furfural and the sum of furfural and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), were also predicted from the responses. The sensors used were metal oxide semi- conductor field effect transistors (MOSFET), tin oxide semiconductor devices, and conductive polymer sensors configured in two sensor arrays. The sensor array response pattern was analyzed by principal component analysis and artificial neural networks.

Nonlinear regression equations accounted for between 77 and 83% of the variation in the annual biomass increment of jack pine when all competing species were combined. Our objective was to determine whether measuring PAR provided any advantage over cover estimation for predicting the effects of interspecific competition. We found no difference in the predictive ability of visual cover estimates and either a single PAR measurement at the point of maximum canopy development or repeated PAR measurements throughout the growing season. Results were consistent among experimental plots that contained a variety of competing plant species with different growth forms. Measurements of PAR transmission once during the growing season performed as well as PAR measurements taken throughout the growing season. Although the precision of plant cover estimates in vegetation sampling has been a concern for some time, high variation in PAR measurements can be created by sensor location sensitivity, narrow sampling windows, and the need for sensor calibration.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/x99-088,Contribution to Book,1999

We selected two important and contrasting upland tree species, Pinus banksiana (jack pine) and Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen), in three distinct climatic zones across the boreal forest of western Canada, and sampled 80 fire-originated stands divided into six chronosequences with ages ranging from 14 to 149 years. The forest floor was a large component of carbon storage. Averaged across ages and zones, it was 1.31 and 2.78 kg C m−2 for P. banksiana and P. tremuloides, respectively, compared with 4.03 and 5.56 kg C m−2 in aboveground trees. These data exclude decomposing coarse woody debris, which was a significant component of the forest floor (0.18/0.13 kg C m−2 ) and requires further study. The contributions from shrubs (0.035/0.151 kg C m−2), ground vegetation (0.019/0.026 kg C m−2), and moss-plus-lichen (0.179/0.004 kg C m−2) were relatively small. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model showed that forest floor carbon was positively related to stand age, as well as being affected by species and climatic zone. Much of the variability was explained by species, and species-specific regression models showed that for P. tremuloides forest floor carbon was strongly related to stand age, mean annual temperature, and mean annual precipitation, and for P. banksiana, forest floor carbon was strongly related to an index of moss dominance. The regression models suggest that the forest floor carbon pool in upland forests of the western Canadian boreal will be sensitive to climate change, but this sensitivity would need to be tested with process-based models.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1999GB900056/full,Article,1999

Pouzar as a biological agent in woody vegetation control. Separate experiments involving manual cuttings of speckled alder (Alnus rugosa (Du Roi) Spreng.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) employed a common suite of treatments and randomized complete block design with five replications. Treatments, applied between June 26 and 29, 1995, included two formulations, each combined with two fungus isolates, 2139 from British Columbia and JAM6 from Ontario. Cutting only (no treatment) and stump treatments with triclopyr (Release®) and blank formulations were used as controls. Two growing seasons after treatment, triclopyr provided significantly greater control of target species than C. purpureum. The fungus exhibited its greatest efficacy on alder, resulting in a 72% reduction in stem volume index and 19% clump mortality over untreated controls. On red maple, isolate 2139 provided a 32% reduction in the volume of stump sprouts. On aspen, both isolates of C. purpureum resulted in a 35% reduction in the volume of stump sprouts and isolate 2139 provided an 88% reduction in the volume of root suckers.

Twenty three taxa, representing nine genera, were identified and counted from 113 samples. At each depth, a theoretical faunal assemblage was derived from the raw counts. The mean and variance of chemical, climatic and physical variables were inferred from modern analogues of the fossil assemblages, using existing autecological data from 6720 sites, mostly in western Canada. These data suggest four paleoenvironments: an early-Holocene (9240–6400 years BP) variable climate supporting aspen parkland vegetation; the warm dry hypsithermal (6400–4500 years BP); a short transitional period of ameliorating climate and expanding subboreal forest (4500–3600 years BP); and the present environment since 3600 years BP. A change in regional climate with the draining of Glacial Lake Agassiz (ca. 8500 years BP) and landsliding in the watershed (ca. 4000 years BP) caused relatively rapid environmental change. The ostracode record generally corroborates the interpretations of other proxy data previously published for Harris Lake. Most of the discrepancy involves the timing and severity of maximum Holocene warmth and aridity. Peak aridity interpreted from the pollen data is earlier than in the other proxy records. Both the diatoms and ostracodes indicate highest paleosalinity between ca. 6500 and 5000 years BP, but maximum salinity in the diatom record occurs between ca. 6000–5700 years BP, whereas the ostracode-inferred salinity is relatively low at this time and peaks later at ca. 5000 years. Neither of these reconstructions suggests the short episodes of hypersalinity interpreted from the mineralogy.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1008031105186,Article,1999

Surveys were conducted, 2 years before and 2 years after logging, to determine the relative abundance of 12 wildlife species, and telemetry data were also gathered on four species. Small mammals, species with the smallest home ranges (≤1 ha), either remained in the clearcut patches or had replacement habitat in the buffer strips. Most species with home ranges up to 25 ha (spruce grouse, Falcipennis canadensis Linné; snowshoe hare, Lepus americanus Erxleben) were excluded from clearcut patches. Species with home ranges ≥5 km2 (marten, Martes americana Turton; moose, Alces alces Linné) remained in some residual forest patches scattered throughout clearcuts and in the adjacent uncut forest. In their home range, these two species avoided clearcut patches where the shrub layer and coniferous regeneration were scattered. Because many wildlife species depend on residual forest, the important issue is not the size of clearcut patches but the extent and configuration of the remaining forest. Instead of a clustered distribution of clearcut patches, we propose two harvest scenarios more compatible with integrated wildlife– forest management objectives on a local scale.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1139/x99-040,Contribution to Book,1999

We explored temperature acclimation of respiration in seedlings of tree species of the North American boreal forest. Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Larix laricina, Pinus banksiana, and Picea mariana plants were grown from seed in controlled-environments at current and elevated concentrations of CO2 (370 and 580 μmol mol–1) in combination with three temperature treatments of 18/12, 24/18, and 30/24 °C (light/dark period). Specific respiration rates of roots and shoots acclimated to temperature, damping increases in rates across growth-temperature environments compared to short-term temperature responses. Compared at a standard temperature, root and shoot respiration rates were, on average, 40% lower in plants grown at the highest compared to lowest growth temperature. Broad-leaved species had a lower degree of temperature acclimation of respiration than did the conifers. Among species and treatment combinations, rates of respiration were linearly related to size and relative growth rate, and relationships were comparable among growth environments. Specific respiration rates and whole-plant respiratory CO2 efflux as a proportion of daily net CO2 uptake increased at higher growth temperatures, but were minimally affected by CO2 concentration. Whole-plant specific respiration rates were two to three times higher in broad-leaved than coniferous species. However, compared to faster-growing broad-leaved species, slower-growing conifers lost a larger proportion of net daily CO2 uptake as respiratory CO2 efflux, especially in roots. Interspecific variation in acclimation responses of dark respiration to temperature is more important than acclimation of respiration to CO2 enrichment in modifying tree seedling growth responses to projected increases in CO2 concentration and temperature.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2486.1999.00257.x/abstract,Article,1999

An increase in rhodamine B concentration in the xylem sap of mercury-treated roots suggested a decrease in the symplastic transport of water. However, the apoplastic pathway in both control and mercury- treated roots constituted only a small fraction of the total root water transport. Electrical conductivity and osmotic potentials of the expressed xylem sap suggested that 0.1 mM HgCl2 and temperature changes over the 4°C to 25°C range did not induce cell membrane leakage. The 0.1 mM HgCl2 solution applied as a root drench se- verely reduced stomatal conductance in intact plants, and this reduction was partly reversed by 50 mM mercaptoethanol. In ex- cised shoots, 0.1 mM HgCl2 did not affect stomatal conductance, suggesting that the signal that triggered stomatal closure originated in the roots. We suggest that mercury-sensitive processes in aspen roots play a significant role in regulating plant water balance by their effects on root hydraulic conductivity.",http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/121/3/939.full.pdf+html,Article,1999

However, most previous research on the impact of change in habitat condition through degradation on these bird communities failed to account for the large intersite differences in both habitat type and extent of degradation. We examined songbird communities in 4 riparian habitat types (meadows, willow-, birch-, and aspen-dominated forest stands) during summers 1994 (last year of a 7-yr drought) and 1995 (following the 6th wettest winter recorded) in the Toiyabe Mountain Range of central Nevada. Habitat degradation significantly influenced bird species richness in riparian areas, but the impact was dependent upon habitat type. While meadow bird communities were affected adversely by habitat degradation, with significant drops in species richness on degraded sites, bird species richness in forested riparian habitats was consistently greater on degraded sites. Data for the 6 most common species seen during our study indicated that degradation may have influenced distribution of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia), but habitat type was the best predictor of abundance for House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus), and Brewer's Blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus). Avian species diversity in meadow habitats may be linked to moisture levels during specific times of the year. Diversity increased during the pre-migratory period of the dry year (1994) when compared with that of the breeding season, but was unchanged in the wet year (1995).",http://www.jstor.org/stable/41713111?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents,Article,1999

During both leafless and full-leaf periods, daytime vertical CO2 concentration gradients above 9 m were weak (<0.2 μmol mol−1 m−1), but were strong below this height. Little change in CO2 storage in the air column below 39.5 m occurred during much of the daytime, while around sunrise and sunset CO2 storage changed mainly below 9 m. For the rest of the night, over 85% of the increase in CO2 storage occurred above 9 m. On some calm nights during the growing season, CO2 also accumulated below 9 m resulting in a sudden upward CO2 flux at 39.5 m following the resumption of mixing 2–3 hours after sunrise. A 10-day experiment was conducted to determine the spatial variability of CO2 flux in the trunk space. Two eddy covariance systems were mounted just above the understory about two tree heights apart. The correlation between CO2 fluxes were poor even under unstable (daytime) conditions, suggesting a relatively heterogeneous understory and soil. In contrast, the correlation between water vapor fluxes was high (r2 = 0.70) in unstable conditions. However, average daytime and nighttime CO2 fluxes over the 10 days agreed to within 5%. This suggests that partitioning net ecosystem exchange between overstory and understory on an hourly basis using a single-understory eddy covariance system is inadvisable; however, partitioning probably can be done quite reliably using 5-day average fluxes.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1999JD900295/abstract,Article,1999

These changes have direct consequences for ecosystem processes, but recent studies of ungulate-ecosystem relations show widely divergent ungulate effects in different ecosystems. We reviewed studies of ungulate effects on plant community composition to gain insight into potential mechanisms of ungulate-induced changes in both community composition and ecosystem processes. Our analysis of these studies is based on the premise that the effect ungulates exert on plant communities depends on the balance between (1) feeding selectivity of herbivores (i.e., degree to which different plant species or ecotypes experience different levels of tissue loss), and (2) differences among plant species in their ability to recover from tissue loss. A large number of studies clearly show that selective ungulate herbivory leads to the dominance of unpalatable, chemically defended plant species in communities. However, many studies have also demonstrated that intensive long-term herbivory does not lead to the invasion of unpalatable species into the community, and can even increase the dominance of highly palatable species. Our review indicates that high levels of nutrient inputs or recycling and an intermittent temporal pattern of herbivory (often due to migration) are key factors increasing the regrowth capacity of palatable species and hence maintaining their dominance in plant communities supporting abundant herbivores. Key factors limiting ungulate foraging selectivity, again limiting herbivore-induced dominance of slow-growing, unpalatable species, include herding behavior, early growing season and postfire herbivory, asynchronous phenology of palatable versus unpalatable species, and low relative abundance of unpalatable species. Our review indicates differences among ecosystems in the role played by ungulate herbivory result from the relative strength of these factors enhancing plant tolerance to herbivory and limiting foraging selectivity. Anthropogenic changes in these factors (e.g., alteration of migration patterns) therefore have the potential to significantly alter the effects of ungulates on plant communities and ecosystem processes.",http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/30180000/AugustinePDF/4.1998_JWildlifeManagement_UngulateEffects_62-1165-1183.pdf,Article,1998

1320,Janet Ann Beales,Fuels Inventory and Appraisal in Intermountain Quaking Aspen (Populus Tremuloides) Communities,MAI,37,3,Not found,Not found,"Field research was conducted in quaking aspen, Populus tremuloides Michx., communities. Fifty-one plots were established in seven major locations in the Bear River Range of northern Utah. The locations inventoried were divided into two age classes: young aspen (under 70 yr) and old aspen (over 70 yr). Custom fuel models were developed for each age class and the data were analyzed for relationships between fuel loads and other measurable factors, including: basal area, average diameter at breast height (d.b.h.), fuel depth, litter loads, tree regeneration, shrub loads, herbaceous loads, slope, tree height, aspect, percent aspen in the plot, grazing intensity, trees infected with disease, elevation, and stand age. The computer program BEHAVE, fuels inventory data, and the two customized fuel models were used to predict fire behavior, including: flame length, fireline intensity, rate of spread, and heat per unit area. Young aspen stands and old aspen stands differed significantly for most of the variables studied. The customized fuel models for the young aspen and old aspen also differed, and these fuel models predicted different fire behavior in the two aspen age classes. When fuel loads were compared to the other stand characteristics inventoried for the 51 plots, fuel loads were most strongly correlated with avenge d.b.h. (F_=.005). Fuel loads were also negatively correlated to grazing intensity (p=.024) for the 51 plots. No significant correlations were found between fuel loads and the other variables when analyzed for the seven locations. In general, stand conditions were not good indicators of fuel loads in aspen communities. Most important to this study were the differences in the fuel data. When used to develop custom fuel models, the young and old aspen fuel models represented two distinct stand types and predicted different fire behavior. Neither fuel models better teptesent aspen communities in the Bear River Range and should be used by managers for fire behavior predictions.",http://cnr.usu.edu/quinney/htm/whatwehave/theses-dissertations/publication=10882,Article,1998

After 13 days on an auxin-free medium, 97% of the treated shoots had rooted. The introduction of known antiauxins (PCIB, PBA, POAA) into the rooting expression auxin-free medium, after the 7-h induction by NAA, completely (PCIB and PBA) or severely (POAA) inhibited rooting. The exclusion of calcium from the expression auxin free medium reduced the percentage of rooting by about 42%. The inhibition was still higher in the presence of EGTA, a calcium chelator. Lanthanum chloride, a calcium channel blocker, also completely inhibited rooting, when incorporated into the auxin free medium, with or without calcium. These results support previous hypotheses about the implication of both endogenous auxin and calcium in the late phases of the adventitious rooting process.",http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/245/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1006182801823.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1006182801823&token2=exp=1434388168~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F245%2Fart%25253A10.1023%25252FA%25253A1006182801823.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1023%252FA%253A1006182801823*~hmac=3d775c76874c8de0a8e1561407facaf660fab00569890baa0d39c3c9ef861925,Article,1998

These were gently dried in a steam-heated rotary drum dryer. Approximately 1 week after drying, surface wettability was measured on a large sample of flakes using an aqueous dye solution. Three replicate boards of each combination of flake species and face grain were then fabricated. Each of the three replicate boards was made with a different adhesive resin. The three adhesives were urea-formaldehyde, phenolic, and neat isocyanate. The procedure (wettability measurements and board fabrication) was repeated at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after flake preparation. Surface wettabilities were reduced as the flake surfaces aged. Tension strengths of boards perpendicular to their faces (internal bond strengths) were also reduced as flake surfaces aged, and reductions in internal bond strengths and surface wettabilities appear to be related. Bending proper- ties were, in general, not influenced by flake age. The ob- served reductions in internal bond strengths suggest that laboratory storage of flakes for much longer than 6 months is not a good practice. However, no conclusive statements can be drawn from this work concerning the influence of flake aging on board properties.",http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplrn/fplrn267.pdf,Document,1998

Use of a contact-agar method to study spore germination has shown that compression of green wood enhances rates of sapwood colonization by two strains of this white-rot fungus. This response was verified by SEM observation and is thought to occur as a result of parenchyma death during chip compression. The colonization of this fungus on softwood chips was also improved as a result of compression.,http://swst.metapress.com/content/a52128j53h8316n4/?p=65520a76cfab48b4962332a01ce096e0π=0,Article,1998

To model PEG diffusion into wood cell walls, a hollow cylinder diffusion model was developed and diffusion coefficients were estimated and compared to those determined with a plane membrane diffusion model. The models gave similar results. The diffusion coefficient of PEG MW 1,000 at room temperature was estimated to be in the order of 10−13 m2/s, while the penetration rates of both PEG 2,000 and 4,000 were about an order lower. These findings indicate that treatments of wood by PEG can be significantly shorter than present practices of soaking green samples in solution if the samples are vacuum/pressure impregnated with PEG solution.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10570-008-9255-z,Article,1998

Unlike observations in control years 1 and 3, radio-collared caribou that had returned to the study area before the road was plowed on January 6 of the experimental year 2, moved away 8-60 km after logging activities began. Seasonal migration to Lake Nipigon islands usually peaked in April, but by February 22 of year 2, 4 of the 6 had returned. The islands provide summer refuge from predation, but not when the lake is frozen. Tracks in snow showed that some caribou remained but changed locations. They used areas near the road preferentially in year 1, early year 2, and year 3, but moved away 2-5 km after the road was plowed in year 2. In a nearby undisturbed control area, no such changes occurred. Caribou and moose partitioned habitat on a small scale; tracks showed gray wolf (Canis lupus) remote from caribou but close to moose tracks. No predation on caribou was observed within the wintering area; 2 kills were found outside it. Due to the possibility of displacing caribou from winter refugia to places with higher predation risk, log hauling through important caribou winter habitat should be minimized.",ptentrio.uit.no/index.php/rangifer/article/view/1562/1467,Article,1998

We have also examined the compatibility and use of the P. tremuloides SSR primers to resolve microsatellites in other Populus species. Fourteen microsatellites were identified from 1600 clones screened. The TC/AG microsatellites were the most abundant. A total of 29 alleles were detected in 36 P. tremuloides individuals at the four SSR loci (two each of di- and tri-nucleotide repeats) characterized. The number of alleles at the SSR loci ranged from 5 to 11, with an average of 7.25 alleles per locus, and the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.19 to 0.82, with a mean of 0.46 per locus. Although the highest polymorphism was observed for a dinucleotide SSR locus, the trinucleotide SSR loci showed substantial polymorphism. There were 34 unique multilocus genotypes among the 36 P. tremuloides individuals examined, and 89% of the individuals had unique multilocus genotypes. Two pairs of SSR primers were successful in PCR, amplifying genomic DNA and resolving microsatellites of comparable size from Populus deltoides, P. nigra, P.×canadensis, and P. maximowiczii. The microsatellite DNA markers developed could be used for clonal fingerprinting, certification of controlled crosses, genome mapping, marker-assisted early selection, genetic diversity assessments, and conservation and sustainable management of poplar genetic resources.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs001220050825,Article,1998

Cover of the bryophytes Nyholmiella obtusifolia, Orthotrichum speciosum, Pylaisia polyantha and Radula complanata(the four most frequent aspen-specific epiphytic bryophytes in this region) was recorded on the bark of 155 systematically sampled aspen stems. In circular plots with 10 m radius surrounding each sampled aspen, information on ground vegetation, soil moisture and stand density was collected. In these plots, and also in plots with 5 m and 20 m radius, stem number and diameters of aspen trees were recorded together with an observation of the presence/absence of the four bryophytes. There was no general and consistent relation between aspen density and presence or abundance of the studied bryophytes. Site, host aspen diameter and forest stand structures were more important for the bryophytes. The site factor explained more of the variation than any of the studied variables. All species except N. obtusifolia were favoured by a large diameter of the host tree, and the density of the surrounding forest stand had a positive effect on the cover ofPyl. polyantha and R. complanata.

A study was initiated in a 64-yr-old trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stand in Meadow Lake Provincial Park, Saskatchewan to determine changes in nutrient dynamics and secondary succession following patch clear-cutting. One hectare replicated patch cuts were logged in the winter of 1993–1994. There was no site preparation following harvest. Annual vegetation, regeneration and soil and plant nutrient data were collected annually, 1 yr prior to, and 3 yr following harvest. Aspen regeneration was 48 375 stems ha–1 2 yr after treatment. Stand (alpha) diversity of the understory was not affected by harvesting, although annual species turnover (beta diversity) increased slightly after harvest. There was an increase in aspen foliar nitrogen (N) for 2 yr following harvest. Soil nutrient concentrations did not differ between patch cut and unharvested plots except total potassium (18% lower in the LFH of the harvested treatments 3 yr after harvesting). Small patch cuts with the litter horizon kept intact may be appropriate for aspen- dominated stands in the boreal mixed wood to minimize ecological disturbance while maintaining aesthetics within a park setting",http://www.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/bookstore_pdfs/4987belongstoPFC.pdf,Article,1998

However, soil temperature data for forest landscapes are scarce. For 6 yr, weekly soil temperatures were measured at two upland and four peatland sites in north central Minnesota. One upland site supported mature aspen forest, the other supported short grass. One peatland site was forested with black spruce, one supported tall willow and alder brush, and two had open vegetation — sedges and low shrubs. Mean annu- al air temperature averaged 3.6°C. Mean annual soil temperatures at 10- to 200-cm depths ranged from 5.5 to 7.6°C among the six sites. Soils with open vegetation, whether mineral or peat, averaged about 1°C warmer annually and from 2 to 3°C warmer dur- ing summer than the forested soils. The tall brush peatland was cooler than all other sites due to strong groundwater inputs. The mineral soils warmed more quickly in the spring, achieved higher temperatures in the summer, and cooled more quickly in the fall than the peat soils; however, the greatest temperature differences between mineral and peat soils occurred at or below 50 cm. In the upper 20 cm, vegetation and groundwater had greater effects on temperature than did soil type (mineral or peat). Summer soil temperatures were higher, relative to air temperature, during periods of greater precipitation. This effect was minimal at upland sites but substantial in the peatlands. In spite of the persistent sub-freezing air temperatures typical of Minnesota winters, signifi- cant frost developed in the soils only in those years when severe cold weather arrived before an insulating cover of snow had accu- mulated.",http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/1998/nc_1998_nichols_001.pdf,Article,1998

A province- wide paired-plot study resulted in old-growth site index adjustments for coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii), interior spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss, P. engelmannii (Parry) Engelm., and P. glauca x P. engelmannii), and interior lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Dougl.). The objective of this study is to develop adjustments for species not covered in the provincial project. Adjustments for the species in the provincial project are also derived for comparison purposes. The data for this study come from temporary and permanent sample plots with a veteran and a main stand component. The site indices for the two components were estimated and an adjustment equation for each species was derived using the two site indices in a linear regression analysis. The veteran component represents an old-growth stand and the main stand component represents a managed stand. The analysis showed that the veteran site indices were being underestimated. Some guidelines on the application of these adjustments to old-growth site indices are provided.",https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/docs/Wp/Wp36.pdf,Article,1998

These algorithms are unique in that they scale up the physics of interception and sublimation from small scales, where they are well understood, to forest stand-scale calculations of intercepted snow sublimation. Evaluation of results from the set of algorithms against measured interception and sublimation, in a southern boreal forest jack pine stand during late winter, found that the coupled model provides reasonable approximations of both interception and sublimation losses on half-hourly, daily and event bases. Cumulative errors in the estimate of intercepted snow load over 23 days of test were 0·06 mm SWE, with a standard deviation of 0·46 mm SWE. Sublimation losses during the evaluation were high, approximately two-thirds of snowfall within this period. Seasonal intercepted snow sublimation as a portion of annual snowfall at the model test site was lower than sublimation during the tests, ranging from 13% for a mixed spruce–aspen, 31% for the mature pine and 40% for a mature spruce stand. The results indicate that sublimation can be a significant abstraction of water from mature evergreen stands in northern forests and that the losses can be calculated by application of process-based algorithms.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1085(199812)12:15%3C2317::AID-HYP799%3E3.0.CO;2-X/abstract,Contribution to Book,1998

The aim of this study was therefore to review the existing knowledge about live-trapping through a literature study, contact with individuals involved in live-trapping, and personal experience. Before starting live-trapping, the area used by the beaver should be determined by careful reconnaissance. Beaver are usually captured either in unbaited traps placed at sites frequently visited by beaver, or in traps baited with castoreum or an aspen twig. Human scent on traps and around the trap site may be reduced by adding mud, water or scent. Usually Bailey or Hancock traps are used for live-trapping beaver. The Hancock trap is preferable because of its greater catch efficiency and versatility. Other traps reviewed are the Breathe Easy trap, Scheffer-Couch trap and different types of cage traps. Other methods used for live-trapping of beaver are snares (often considered highly effective), the Byelorussian trapping method, nets and seines, landing nets, pits and enclosures. Capture methods involving the destruction of lodges/dens and dams have often been employed in the past. Such methods require special permission in most countries and are usually not to be recommended. The Eurasian beaver (C. fiber Linnaeus, 1758) is reportedly more difficult to live-trap than its North American counterpart (C. canadensis Kuhl, 1820). New, effective methods for live-trap- ping of beaver also need to be developed.",https://dspace01.hit.no/bitstream/handle/2282/326/Faunanorvegica2.pdf?sequence=1,Article,1998

Soil biological activity was measured at four sites with Luvisolic soil following clear-cut forest har- vesting. Aerobic respiration rate and cellulose decomposition in flooded soils were measured on soil samples collected from treat- ment plots subjected to tree removal only and tree removal associated with three levels of skidding activity immediately after clear-cut harvesting and after 1 and 2 yr. More than half of variation in respiration and cellulose decomposition rates was related to soil properties. Soil respiration rate increased significantly after 1 yr but was not affected by skidder traffic. Cellulose decom- position was highest in soil with air-filled porosity <0.10 m3 m–3, and increased significantly with skidder traffic. Air-filled porosity measured in the field at the time of harvest indicated a poorly aerated environment that becomes wetter in subsequent years. The results imply that soil had biota well adapted to poor soil aeration. The development of a fully anaerobic soil environment fol- lowing forest harvesting only occurred on compacted soil after heavy precipitation, but partial anaerobiosis of these boreal forest soils was common. Although partial anaerobiosis increased decomposition rate, it is considered sufficient to adversely affect the growth of plant roots and change the availability and mobility of nutrients.",http://pubs.aic.ca/doi/pdf/10.4141/S97-028,Article,1998

The collection of ESTs reflects the level and complexity of gene expression in the sampled tissue. To date, the majority of plant ESTs are from nonwoody plants such as Arabidopsis, Brassica, maize, and rice. Here, we present a large-scale production of ESTs from the wood-forming tissues of two poplars, Populus tremula L. × tremuloides Michx. and Populus trichocarpa ‘Trichobel.’ The 5,692 ESTs analyzed represented a total of 3,719 unique transcripts for the two cDNA libraries. Putative functions could be assigned to 2,245 of these transcripts that corresponded to 820 protein functions. Of specific interest to forest biotechnology are the 4% of ESTs involved in various processes of cell wall formation, such as lignin and cellulose synthesis, 5% similar to developmental regulators and members of known signal transduction pathways, and 2% involved in hormone biosynthesis. An additional 12% of the ESTs showed no significant similarity to any other DNA or protein sequences in existing databases. The absence of these sequences from public databases may indicate a specific role for these proteins in wood formation. The cDNA libraries and the accompanying database are valuable resources for forest research directed toward understanding the genetic control of wood formation and future endeavors to modify wood and fiber properties for industrial use.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC23802/,Article,1998

H., Waddington, J., Horton, P. R. and Nuttall, W. F. 1997. Long-term effects of fertilizer on yield and species composition of contrasting pasture swards in the Aspen Parkland of the Northern Great Plains. Can. J. Plant Sci. 77: 607–614. Little is known about the effects of long-term application of fertilizer on the complex pasture swards of the Aspen Parkland region of western Canada. Experiments were conducted, lasting from 1980 to 1992, on five contrasting swards representative of permanent pastures in northeast Saskatchewan to determine the long-term effects of N, P, K and S fertilizer on herbage yield and species composition. The experimental swards consisted primarily of smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L), and creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L.), in varying amounts. Seven fertilizer treatments were applied at each site from 1980 to 1991 (shown as N-P-K-S in kg ha–1): 0-0-0-0, 45-0-0-0, 45-20-0-0, 90-0-0-0, 90-20-0-0, 90-20-50-20, 180-20-0-0. Another treatment (90-20-0-20) was added in 1984. An area within each plot was protected from grazing with wire exclosures and harvested in July and September. Harvested samples were classified according to coarse- leafed grasses (mostly smooth bromegrass), fine-leafed grasses (mostly Kentucky bluegrass and creeping red fescue), legumes and weeds before drying and weighing. Ground cover composition of all plots was measured by a modified line transect technique in 1980, 1987 and 1992. All swards, regardless of species composition, responded positively to fertilizer. The yield increase obtained from applying 45 or 90 kg N ha–1 (0.8 and 0.7 t ha–1, respectively) was more than doubled by adding 20 kg P ha–1 with the N. Nitrogen applied alone did not affect the proportion of bromegrass but increased the proportion of fine grasses in the herbage; adding N and P increased the proportion of coarse grass and at the expense of fine grasses. With respect to sward composition, N decreased the proportion of bromegrass and increased the proportion of bluegrass and fescue whereas adding N and P had the opposite effect. Application of S increased yield 0.9 to 1.8 t ha–1 and greatly increased the proportion of bromegrass in the sward and the harvested herbage of the three sites with low levels of soil S. The residual effect of the N and P treatments on yield was small but the effect on species composition of the herbage was substantial; S produced a residual effect on yield in 1992 and a large residual effect on species composition. The results indicate the need for balanced nutrient application to enhance yield and maintain or improve sward species composition of pastures in the Aspen Parkland. Fertilizer can be used to improve yield on a wide range of sward types.",http://pubs.aic.ca/doi/pdf/10.4141/P96-146,Article,1997

BSP) develops an adventitious root system along the base of the stem. The development of such adventitious roots, coupled with the buildup of the forest floor with time, means that the root collar of mature trees is located under these adventitious roots, below ground level. To examine the validity of ring counts at ground level for black spruce age determinations, the stumps of 39 understory trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) were excavated and cut into 2-cm cross sections, sanded, and the age estimated by cross-dating techniques. Cross-dating below the adventitious roots added 3–19 years to the age estimates compared with the age at ground level. All study trees demonstrated a reverse taper in the buried part of the stem, such that the recent growth rings were progressively lacking in the sections closer to the true root collar. The stem of most of the trees also had a horizontal or sinuous juvenile growth period, which was now included in the stump wood. This age underestimation from ring counts at ground level appears to explain discrepancies in the literature regarding the postfire establishment period of black spruce.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/x97-086,Article,1997

Specific goals are (1) to determine if the maple-basswood stands at Rydell NWR existed historically, and (2) to compare the composition of the Rydell NWR stands to maple-basswood ""core"" sites, as well as other outlier sites. Public Land Survey records for the period between 1872 and 1876 for a 16-township block encom­ passing Rydell NWR indicate that, although this area was dominated by an oak-aspen forest type, a distinct maple-basswood region existed prior to European settlement and this had escaped disturbance from fire and wind. Present-day stand composition data from six Rydell stands are compared with published data from other maple-basswood stands, using detrended correspondence analysis. A strong geographic pattern is indicated in the ordi­ nation diagram, which is attributed to differences in September precipitation and actual evapotranspiration between the sites. Local-scale environmental gradients act to modify the dominant climatic trend on composition, however, as some Rydell stands plotted close­ ly to the core region in ordination space, whereas other Rydell stands demonstrated greater similarity to oak and aspen stands in North Dakota.

Selectable marker genes conferring antibiotic or herbicide resistance, used to introduce economically valu- able genes into crop plants, have three major problems: (i) the selective agents have negative effects on proliferation and differentiation of plant cells; (ii) there is uncertainty regard- ing the environmental impact of many selectable marker genes; (iii) it is difficult to perform recurrent transformations using the same selectable marker to pyramid desirable genes. The MAT vector system containing the ipt gene and the Ac element is designed to overcome these difficulties. When tobacco leaf segments were transformed and selected, subse- quent excision of the modified Ac produced marker-free transgenic tobacco plants without sexual crosses or seed production. In addition, the chimeric ipt gene could be visually used as a selectable marker for transformation of hybrid aspen (Populus sieboldii 􏰂 Populus grandidentata). The chi- meric ipt gene, therefore, is an attractive alternative to the most widely used selectable marker genes. The MAT vector system provides a promising way to shorten breeding time for genetically engineered crops.

Measurements were made at the southern study area (SSA) and northern study area (NSA) of the boreal forest in central Canada as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). In both the NSA and the SSA there were significant differences in photosynthesis among the major tree species, with aspen having the highest CO2 assimilation rates and spruce the lowest. Within a species, photosynthetic rates in the SSA were approximately twice those measured in the NSA, and this was correlated with similar variations in stomatal conductance. Calculations of the ratio of leaf intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration (ci/ca) from leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) values indicated a relatively low degree of stomatal limitation of photosynthesis, despite the low absolute values of stomatal conductance in these boreal tree species. Within each ecosystem, leaf Δ values were strongly correlated with life-form groups (trees, shrubs, forbs, and mosses), and these differences are maintained between years. Although we observed significant variation in the 13C content of tree rings at the old Jack pine site in the NSA during the past decade (indicating interannual variation in the degree of stomatal limitation), changes in summer precipitation and temperature accounted for only 44% of the isotopic variance. We scaled leaf-level processes to the ecosystem level through analyses of well-mixed canopy air. On average, all three forest types had similar ecosystem-level Δ values (average value ± standard deviation, 19.1‰±0.5‰), calculated from measurements of change in the concentration and carbon isotope ratio of atmospheric CO2 during a diurnal cycle within a forest canopy. However, there were seasonal changes in ecosystem discrimination for aspen forests, while the evergreen conifer forests exhibited relatively constant discrimination values throughout the active growing season.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/97JD01235/full,Article,1997

Analyses of vegetation-climate relationships have been conducted as a simple scaling technique to identify the most important long-term factors controlling the boundary between boreal forest and grassland in western Canada. In an earlier study, the boundary was found to correspond closely to the zero isoline of a climatic moisture index, based on mean annual precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (PET) by the lensen-Haise method. In this study, similar results were obtained using PET estimates from the more process-based Priestley-Taylor equation or a simplified form of the Penman-Monteith equation, although actual PET estimates were sensitive to input parameters. It is concluded, based on this analysis and other evidence, that forest distribution in the region is controlled by chronic moisture deficits.

All these factors have a spatial nature, and consequently an approach to characterization of ozone risk is presented that places ozone exposure–response func- tions for species as seedlings and model-simulated tree and stand responses in a spatial context using a geographical information systems (GIS). The GIS is used to aggregate factors considered important in a risk characterization, in- cluding: (1) estimated ozone exposures over forested re- gions, (2) measures of ozone effects on species’ and stand growth, and (3) spatially distributed environmental, genetic, and exposure influences on species’ response to ozone. The GIS-based risk characterization provides an estimation of the extent and magnitude of the potential ozone impact on forests. A preliminary risk characterization demonstrating this approach considered only the eastern United States and only the limited empirical data quantifying the effect of ozone exposures on forest tree species as seedlings. The area- weighted response of the annual seedling biomass loss formed the basis for a sensitivity ranking: sensitive—aspen and black cherry (14%–33% biomass loss over 50% of their distribution); moderately sensitive—tulip popular, loblolly pine, eastern white pine, and sugar maple (5%–13% bio- mass loss); insensitive—Virginia pine and red maple (0%–1% loss). In the future, the GIS-based risk characteriza- tion will include process-based model simulations of the three- to 5-year growth response of individual species as large trees with relevant environmental interactions and model simulated response of mixed stands. The interactive nature of GIS provides a tool to explore consequences of the range of climate conditions across a species’ distribution, forest management practices, changing ozone precursors, regulatory control strategies, and other factors influencing the spatial distribution of ozone over time as more informa- tion becomes available.",http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/301/art%253A10.1007%252Fs002679900010.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs002679900010&token2=exp=1434659862~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F301%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs002679900010.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs002679900010*~hmac=4544a2ae9d06d63edd52c9e9cbef0ddd004fd6df1419623ab6acbde35f7c212c,Article,1997

Model simulations of daily net carbon exchange of the ecosystem (NEE) explained 51.7% (SE = 1.32 g C m−2 day−1) of the variance in daily NEE derived from stand eddy flux measurements of CO2 during 1994. Differences between measured and simulated results were attributed to several factors including difficulties associ- ated with measuring nighttime CO2 fluxes and model assump- tions of site homogeneity. However, comparisons between simulations and field data improved markedly at coarser time- scales. Model simulations explained 66.1% (SE = 0.97 g C m −2 day−1) of the variance in measured NEE when 5-day means of daily results were compared.

Atmospheres,102,D24,Not found,Not found,"BIOME-BGC is a general ecosystem model designed to simulate hydrologic and biogeochemical processes across multiple scales. The objectives of this investigation were to compare BIOME-BGC estimates of hydrologic processes with observed data for different boreal forest stands and investigate factors that control simulated water fluxes. Model results explained 62 and 98% of the respective variances in observed daily evapotranspiration and soil water; simulations of the onset of spring thaw and the dates of snowpack disappearance and accumulation also generally tracked observations. Differences between observed and simulated evapotranspiration were attributed to model assumptions of constant, growing season, overstory leaf areas that did not account for phenological changes and understory effects on stand daily water fluxes. Vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation accounted for 58–74% of the variances in simulated daily evapotranspiration during the growing season, though low air temperature and photosynthetic light levels were found to be the major limiting factors regulating simulated canopy conductances to water vapor. Humidity and soil moisture were generally not low enough to induce physiological water stress in black spruce stands, though low soil water potentials resulted in approximate 34% reductions in simulated mean daily canopy conductances for aspen and jack pine stands. The sensitivity of evapotranspiration simulations to leaf area (LAI) was less than expected because of opposing responses of transpiration and evaporation to LAI. The results of this investigation identify several components within boreal forest stands that are sensitive to climate change.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/97JD02235/abstract,Article,1997

Stands included old and young aspen (OA, YA) associated with the hazelnut shrub, old and young jack pine (OJP, YJP) stands, and an old black spruce (OBS) stand; white spruce (at YA) and an understory herb (dogbane, at OJP) were also examined. Midsummer peak photosynthesis for aspen leaves in the field (A, light saturated) and laboratory (Amax light and CO2 saturated) was ∼12.6 and 33–41 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1. Black spruce exhibited the lowest A, 3 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1. Jack pine and black spruce attained their highest Amax (17–20 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) in late summer/early fall. Gas exchange by white spruce was significantly higher and stomatal limitation lower than for other conifers, at levels comparable to broadleaf responses. White spruce foliage had the highest chlorophyll content in fall (∼41 μg cm−2), followed by aspen (OA) and hazelnut (YA) in midsummer (∼31 μg cm−2). Specific leaf mass of aspen, hazelnut, and conifer foliage was 86, ∼47, and ∼174 g m−2, respectively. Leaf nitrogen content of broadleaves (18–40 g N g−1 dry wt) was 2–3 times greater than conifer needles (8–12 g N g−1). Significantly larger needles were produced at OJP versus YJP, but needle number per age class was greater at YJP. The absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fraction (fAPAR) in June/July averaged ∼80% for broadleaves and ∼83% in conifer needles. The simple ratio (SR, near-infrared/red ratio) calculated from foliar transmittances was more strongly related to fAPAR than SR calculated from reflectances, with stronger correlation for broadleaves (r=0.92) than for conifers (r=0.78).",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/97JD02560/full,Article,1997

The goal of this paper is to present progress in mapping above ground woody biomass over portions of the BOREAS southern study area using spaceborne sensor data. Relationships of backscatter to total biomass and total biomass to foliage, branch, and bole biomass are used to estimate biomass across the landscape. The procedure involves image classification with SAR and Landsat data and development of simple mapping techniques using combinations of SAR channels. The analysis uses measurements from forest stands representing a range of biomass and structures. Field measurements included plot level mensuration (species, stem diameter, height, density, and basal area) and tree geometry measurements (leaf, branch, bole size, and angle distributions). The results indicate that aboveground biomass can be estimated to within about 1.6 kg/m2 and up to about 15 kg/m2 across the SIR-C image evaluated. A general method produced equivalent results with those obtained by treating forest type (pine, spruce, and aspen) separately. The biomass mapping was extended to bole, branch, and foliage components from relationships with total aboveground biomass developed from detailed tree measurements. Average biomass within the imaged area was estimated to be about 7.3 kg/m2 with biomass components of bole, branch, and foliage comprising 83, 12, and 5% of the total. Examination of the scaling of biomass estimates from remote sensing images of varying resolution shows that information at scales useful for ecosystem models can be obtained. In addition, the biomass estimation technique provides similar information at different image resolutions.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/96JD03708/abstract,Article,1997

We investigated the effects of CO2 and water availability on phytochemistry of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and the associated performance of the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hbn.). Seedlings were grown under ambient or elevated CO2 concentrations and under well-watered or drought conditions. We measured rates of gas exchange and subjected foliage to phytochemical assays. Bioassays were conducted to quantify larval performance on foliage from the various treatments. In general, elevated CO2 increased photosynthetic rates and had no effect on stomatal conductance, while drought reduced both parameters. Foliar nitrogen levels declined and secondary metabolite concentrations increased under enriched CO2, but starch and sugar levels were unaffected. All phytochemicals measured, with the exception of simple sugars, declined or did not change in response to drought. CO2- and drought-mediated changes in phytochemistry reduced forest tent caterpillar growth and food processing efficiencies, but the patterns were host-species specific. This work demonstrates that CO2 effects on forest trees will be mediated by the availability of water and that the direction and magnitude of responses will depend on the tree species involved, which will, in turn, affect patterns of host use by herbivorous insects.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/x97-031,Article,1997

We estimated annual Ra from chamber measurements in aspen, black spruce, and jack pine forests in Canada for 1994. Mean foliage respiration at 10°C for expanded leaves was 0.21–0.95 μmol m−2 (leaf surface) s−1 for all species and differed little from May to September. Wood respiration at 15°C (0.2–1 μmol m−2 (stem surface) s−1 for all species) was strongly seasonal, with high rates in midsummer that coincided with wood growth. Fine root respiration at 10°C was 2.5–7.7 μmol kg−1 s−1 for all species and declined throughout the growing season for the conifers. Annual costs of Ra for foliage, wood, and roots (overstory and understory) were 490, 610, and 450 g C m−2 (ground) yr−1 for aspen, black spruce, and jack pine (old) in northern Manitoba and 600, 480, and 310 g C m−2 yr−1 for aspen, black spruce, and jack pine (old) in central Saskatchewan. Carbon use efficiency (CUE), the ratio of net production to production plus Ra, averaged 0.44, 0.34, and 0.39 for aspen, black spruce, and jack pine (old) for all tissues and 0.61, 0.36, and 0.44 for aboveground tissues. Differences in CUE between the northern and the southern sites were small for all species, and CUE did not vary with stand biomass. Species differences in CUE suggest that models assuming a constant CUE across species may poorly estimate production and carbon balance for any given site.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/97JD01236/epdf,Article,1997

The climate of the Southern Study Area (SSA) near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan is warmer and drier in the summer and milder in the winter than the Northern Study Area (NSA) near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. In- growth soil cores and minirhizotrons were used to quantify fine root net primary production (NPPFR). Average daily fine root growth (m m−2 day−1) was positively correlated with soil temperature at 10-cm depth (r2 = 0.83--0.93) for all three species, with black spruce showing the strongest temperature effect. At both study areas, fine root biomass (measured from soil cores) and fine root length (measured from minirhizotrons) were less for jack pine than for the other two species. Except for the aspen stands, estimates of NPPFR from minirhizotrons were significantly greater than estimates from ingrowth cores. The core method underestimated NPPFR because it does not account for simultaneous fine root growth and mortality. Minirhizotron NPPFR estimates ranged from 59 g m−2 year−1 for aspen stands at SSA to 235 g m−2 year−1 for black spruce at NSA. The ratio of NPPFR to total detritus production (above- ground litterfall + NPPFR) was greater for evergreen forests than for deciduous forests, suggesting that carbon allocation patterns differ between boreal evergreen and deciduous forests. In all stands, NPPFR consistently exceeded annual fine root turnover and the differences were larger for stands in the NSA than for stands in the SSA, whereas the difference between study areas was only significant for black spruce. The imbal- ance between NPPFR and fine root turnover is sufficient to explain the net accumulation of carbon in boreal forest soils.",http://treephys.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/8-9/577.full.pdf+html,Contribution to Book,1997

The first period, 1820–1900, in- cluded entrance by European-Americans, displacement of Native Americans, the discovery of gold, and the development of other re- sources such as timber, water, rangeland, and scenic sites. Concern for the effects of this development led to the creation of Yosemite Valley as a state park and the designation of Sequoia and Yosemite (not including the valley) as national parks. Additional Sierra Nevada forestland was included in several federal forest reserves. No effec- tive system of regulation accompanied the creation of these areas, however. The second period of the Sierra Nevada’s history, 1900– 1940, saw the creation of the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service and the beginning of effective management of Sierra Nevada resources by these agencies. Even as federal action was being taken, private development of natural resources continued, especially logging. Automobile access stimulated recreation demand. Decisions to provide Sierra Nevada water for San Francisco, Los Angeles, and numerous hydroelectric projects affected the range as well through this period. The third period of the range’s environmen- tal history, 1940–60, was marked by accelerated use of all of its re- sources, especially timber and water. Improvements in automobile transportation led to increased winter uses associated with skiing. Federal and state agencies responded by trying to meet these grow- ing demands. By 1960, many environmental groups and some ele- ments within the federal services began to express concern over the effects of such accelerated growth. A period of environmental activ- ism in the Sierra Nevada was about to begin.",http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-43/VOL_II/VII_C01.PDF,Contribution to Book,1996

Occurrences involving moose were recorded at local Alberta Natural Resources Service (NRS) district offices. A total of 1130 occurrence reports involving moose throughout Alberta between January 1 and April 30, 1999 were submitted to the author for review. Although there was considerable inherent bias in the sample, some general patterns emerged. Most moose (92%) had evidence of hairloss and 28% of them were dead. In the overall sample, 35% were calves; however in the subsample of dead moose with hairloss, 43% were calves. It is assumed that the hairloss was a result of infestation with winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus. Most occurrences (96%) were within the boreal habitats of northern and western Alberta and half of them were recorded in March (50%). It is apparent that excessive mortality of moose, particularly calves, occurred in late winter. The outbreak is considered a direct result of the interactions among moose, ticks, habitat, and weather. Weather appears to have been the ultimate force driving the interactions. Late winter snow cover and moose densities may provide clues for potential management actions in the subsequent fall period.",http://aep.alberta.ca/fish-wildlife/wildlife-diseases/documents/MooseTicksAlbertaADieOff-Oct-1999.pdf,Article,1996

For ethanol production, the process was studied in continuous aerated conditions with a respiratory deficient mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CBS 1200, associated with Pichia stipitis NRRL 11545 and using a microfiltration membrane assisted bioreactor. Using a synthetic medium (35 g/l glucose, 15 g/l xylose), the highest fermentative performances were obtained at D=0.1 h−1. Under these conditions, ethanol was produced with a yield of 0.43 g/g and a volumetric rate of 2 g/l/h. The glucose and xylose conversion yields were, respectively, 100 and 60%, giving an overall substrate conversion yield of 88%. At D=0.13 h−1 with the medium containing aspen wood hydrolysate as carbon source (glucose 41 g/l, xylose 9 g/l), ethanol was produced with a volumetric rate of 2.9 g/l/h, a yield of 0.46 g/g and the substrate conversion yield was 94%. For xylitol production, the utilization of Lactobacillus reuterii in association with the xylitol producing yeast, Candida guilliermondii permits to reduce the accumulation of arabinitol from arabinose and to produce xylitol from a synthetic medium (xylose 40 g/l, glucose 10 g/l, arabinose 10 g/l), with a purity up to 98%.

On arid and semiarid rangelands, evapotranspiration can account for over 90% of the precipitation, making accurate knowledge of the surface energy balance particularly critical. Recent advances in measurement and modeling have made the accurate estimate of ET and the entire surface energy balance possible. The Simultaneous Heat and Water model, a detailed physical process model capable of simulating the effects of a multispecies plant canopy on heat and water transfer, was applied to 2 years of data collected for three vegetation types on a semiarid watershed. Timing and magnitude of ET from the three sites differed considerably. Measured and simulated ET for approximately 26 days of measurement in 1990 were 41 and 44 mm, respectively, for the low sagebrush, 74 and 69 mm for the mountain big sagebrush, and 85 and 89 mm for the aspen. Simulated and measured cumulative ET for up to 85 days of measurement at the three sites in 1993 differed by 35%. Simulated diurnal variation in each of the surface energy balance components compared well with measured values.

In general, flowering plant species released their pollen in early to late May, while conifer (spruce and pine) pollen release occurred in early to mid-June. Pollen deposition was poorly correlated with relative species abundance in the community, with some species (e.g., jack pine) being over-represented in the pollen rain and others (e.g., aspen poplar) being under-represented. In 1993, spruce pollen deposition was 63% of that in 1992. By contrast, total pollen deposition by jack pine showed little variation from 1991 to 1993. However, pollen release dates varied between years, occurring earlier in years with warmer spring temperatures.

The model developed here is a spatially-explicit ecologically-mechanistic simulator based on previous work in vital attributes theory and fuzzy systems theory. The model employs multiple individual forest stands with spatially-linked processes of seed distribution and disturbance propagation. Two synthetic landscapes were constructed consisting of four distinct environments with 400 polygons arranged in a hex grid mapped onto a torus. The two landscapes differ in inherent environmental heterogeneity, with one landscape consisting of smooth gradation in the four environments (gradient landscape) and the other with randomized environments (random landscape). The two landscapes are subjected to five different fire regimes. The effects of fire regime, environmental heterogeneity, and the interaction of environmental heterogeneity and fire regime are presented with regard to landscape characteristics of fragmentation, patch diversity, and gamma diversity. Environmental heterogeneity and fire regime form a complex relationship of non-monotonic response and interaction effects. Landscape fragmentation and diversity are found to have a modal or sinusoidal relationship to fire return interval, and the positions of the minima and maxima differ between the random and gradient landscapes. Landscape gamma diversity shows relatively less effect of fire return interval, although longer fire return intervals generally produce higher gamma diversity through the development of higher alpha diversity in mesic fire-sensitive stands. An interaction exists between landscape heterogeneity and fire return interval where some fire return intervals accentuate and some attenuate the differences between the gradient and random landscapes. Interaction effects of environmental heterogeneity and fire return interval on gamma diversity are small.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304380095001646?np=y,Article,1996

Inventory dates, by state, were 1980 and 1993 for Michigan, 1977 and 1990 for Minnesota, and 1968 and 1983 for Wisconsin. In this paper, timberland is considered forest land that is capable of growing at least 1.4 cu m per ha per year of wood under natural conditions and that is not reserved from harvesting. (Old forests are more than 120 years old, and potential old forests are between 80 and 120 years old). During the most recent inventory, 2% of the total area of timberland was old forest and 14% was potential old forest. The maple-beech-yellow birch (Acer-Fagus-Betula alleghaniensis) forest type accounted for about 40% of both old forest and potential old forest. Private landowners owned more than 70% of all old forest timberland in the previous inventory and 64% in the most recent inventory. On average, old forests and potential old forests were found significantly farther from maintained roads than other timberland. As a result of increased stand age, more than 200 thousand ha of potential old forest in the previous inventory were reclassified as old forest in the most recent inventory. Natural disturbances resulted in a decrease of almost 14 thousand ha of old forest between inventory periods. Human-induced disturbances accounted for most of the area of old forest lost between inventories. Plant succession, natural stand aging, improved stocking levels, or reclassification to timberland resulted in more than 1.2 million ha being reclassified as potential old forest.",http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0378112796037796/1-s2.0-S0378112796037796-main.pdf?_tid=a9408412-20cd-11e5-a40d-00000aacb35f&acdnat=1435850518_8cd19ed64113dde53cb407bbf5e0da60,Article,1996

Populations of several species of old-growth specialists in lodgepole pine live also in younger, fire-origin stands in boreal aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux.) stands of the ""mixedwood"" zone. We hypothesize that they have recolonized from the large surrounding tracts of unburned residual forest remaining after fire. Thus, landscape-scale effects, resulting in changes in regional population size, may alter the probability of species retention in old-growth fragments, and of the recolonization of cut-blocks by particular species characteristic of old-growth.",http://nofc.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/bookstore_pdfs/18933.pdf,Article,1996

The problem of temporal autocorrelation is exacerbated by the uneven temporal spacing inherent in many data sets. Using simple linear regression models of stomatal conductance as examples, we compare the effectiveness of two methods for removing temporal autocorrelation from regression models and we introduce the geostatistical technique of semivariograms as a method for quantifying temporal autocorrelation in uneven time series. The Cochrane-Orcutt method proved more effective than first-differencing at removing autocorrelation and produced regression models without changing the significance of the independent variables. Semivariograms were used to quantify the time dependence of the unevenly spaced stomatal conductance time series. This technique revealed the dominant autocorrelation at the minimum time lag and the 24-h periodicity caused by the climatological variables used in the model. We conclude that geostatistical techniques provide a robust method for quantifying temporal structure and periodicity in unevenly spaced time series.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/x26-094,Article,1996

Two equations based on the Froude number underestimated flame angle for most wind and slope combinations; however, the data support theory that flame angle is a function of the square root of the Froude number. Discrepancies between data and predictions were attributed to measurement difficulties and slope effects. An equation based on Byram's convection number accounted for nearly half of the observed variation in flame angle (R 2 = 0.46).

Fire acts as a mineralizing agent, releasing nutrients in available forms. However, nitrogen is lost during fires, which can further deplete this limiting nutrient. Without fire, nitrogen becomes tied up in partially decom- posed litter (needles and woody debris). The problems faced by manag- ers of these forest systems are how and when to use fire from a nutrient perspective. A chronosequence of fire intervals in ponderosa pine forests (Pinus ponderosa) was studied to determine (1) if nitrogen cycling pro- cesses (mineralization and nitrification) decrease and (2) if concentrations of organics that inhibit these processes increase along the fire chronosequence. Patterns were not statistically significant, but fairly clear trends occurred. Nitrogen mineralization and nitrification patterns were higher in sites recentry burned (within two years) and were lowest in sites without fire since the 1890's. The patterns at intermediate age sites var- ied, perhaps because of differential usage by elk and variable amounts of needle scorch which resulted in differential needle litterfall after fire. Within a site, concentrations of certain monoterpenes were consistently nega- tively correlated with rates of nitrification and mineralization. In these sys- tems, fire promotes more rapid cycling of nitrogen, in part through com- bustion of monoterpene inhibitors.",http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_rm/rm_gtr286/rm_gtr286_123_139.pdf,Contribution to Book,1996

The primary factor limiting plant colonization is the acidic and aluminum-, copper-, and nickel-toxic properties of the soils, although certain plant species survive the challenges through genetically based metal tolerance. In revegetation programs, the soil can be detoxified sufficiently to initiate colonization by the surface application of ground limestone. The drought vulnerability of seedlings, resulting from soil toxicity limiting root growth, is exacerbated by enhanced frost action resulting from the lack of leaf litter. Manual surface application of ground limestone, with or without an accompanying fertilizer and (or) grass-legume seed application, leads to immediate colonization by woody species including birch, aspen, and willows, and more than 3000 ha have been treated in this way by the Regional Municipality of Sudbury since",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/a96-011,Article,1996

In order to optimize this process, a rapid and reliable method was needed to predict energy savings. In this paper, we examine a fiber staining method that involves the use of Simons stain. This stain for microscopic examination of pulp fibers has been used previously to evaluate the degree of fibrillation in beaten fibers or more recently to differentiate fibers from untreated (control) and fungus-treated wood chips. Aspen or loblolly pine wood chips were treated with white-rot fungi under different experimental conditions in static-bed bioreactors for two or four weeks. At harvest, control and fungus-treated chips were refined through a single-disk me- chanical refiner and then evaluated for fiber staining characteristics and the energy consumption during refining. Fibers obtained from control pulps stained a deep blue, whereas those obtained from different biopulps showed different intensities of yellow. The yellowing of biopulp fibers correlated very well with energy savings. The results demonstrate that the Simons staining method can accurately predict appreciable energy savings during biomechanical pulping and therefore can be used as a rapid screening technique to optimize the biopulping process.",http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1995/akhta95a.pdf,Article,1995

At 1 atm, a potassium-sulfate-rich liquid forms at high temperatures (1050°C) and persists to a temperature of between 975 and 1000°C, where it crystallizes to form solid alkali sulfates. At 4 and 10 atm the liquid crystallizes above 1000°C. The formation of sulfate is limited by the low abundance of sulfur, which is greatly depleted at 1000°C. A large fraction of the alkali remains in the vapor as the KOH molecule at this temperature. Both KOH and CaO react with CO2 in the vapor to form the solid carbonates K2Ca2(CO3)3 and CaCO3 below 800° at 1 atm. At 4 atm, a potentially corrosive molten carbonate forms at temperatures in the range of 800–875°C. Below 800°C all the carbonate crystallizes to CaCO3 and K2Ca2(CO3)3. Upon cooling at 10 atm, the liquid forms somewhat above 900°C and crystallizes somewhat above 800°C to form these solid carbonates.

Chemical analyses in the laboratory indicate the con- centrations of elements in soils, but the thickniss and bulk density of the soil layers in the fieid must be considered to estimate the quantities of elements per unit area. Conventional methods that calculate organic matter storage as the product of concentration, bulk density and thickness do not fully account for variations in soil mass. Comparisons between the quantities of organic C, N, P and S in bray Luviscl soils under nitive aspen forest and various cropping systems were hampered by differences in the mass of soil under consideraiion. The influence of these differences was eliminated by calculating the masses of C, N, P and S in an ""equivalent soil mass"" (i.e. the mass of soil in a standard or reference surface layer). Reassessment of previously published data also indicated that estimates of organic matter storage depended on soil mass. Appraisals of organic matter depletion or accumr- lation usually were different for cimparisonr u-ong element masses in an equivalent soil mass than for comparisons among ele- ment massei in genetic horizons or in frxed sampling depths. Unless soil erosion or deposition had altered the mass of topsoil per unit area, comparisons among unequal soil massei were unjustified and erroneous. For management-induced changes in soil organic matter and nutrient storage to be assessed reliably, the masses of soil being compared must be equivalent.",http://pubs.aic.ca/doi/pdfplus/10.4141/cjss95-075,Article,1995

We in- vestigated whether the observed trophic cascade might have a behavioral basis by exploring environmental factors influencing the movements of 13 female elk equipped with GPS radio collars. We developed a simple statistical approach that can unveil the concurrent influence of several environmental features on animal movements. Paths of elk traveling on their winter range were broken down into steps, which correspond to the straight-line segment between successive locations at 5-hour intervals. Each observed step was paired with 200 random steps having the same starting point, but differing in length and/or direction. Com- parisons between the characteristics of observed and random steps using conditional logistic regression were used to model environmental features influencing movement patterns. We found that elk movements were influenced by multiple factors, such as the distance from roads, the presence of a steep slope along the step, and the cover type in which they ended. The influence of cover type on elk movements depended on the spatial distribution of wolves across the northern winter range of the park. In low wolf-use areas, the relative preference for end point locations of steps followed: aspen stands 􏰂 open areas 􏰂 conifer forests. As the risks of wolf encounter increased, the preference of elk for aspen stands gradually decreased, and selection became strongest for steps ending in conifer forests in high wolf-use areas. Our study clarifies the behavioral mechanisms involved in the trophic cascade of Yellowstone’s wolf–elk–aspen system: elk respond to wolves on their winter range by a shift in habitat selection, which leads to local reductions in the use of aspen by elk.",http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/04-0953,Article,1995

Fredlund,"Late Quaternary Pollen Record From Cheyenne Bottoms, Kansas",Quaternary Research Orlando,43,1,67 - 79,Not found,"A sediment and pollen record from Cheyenne Bottoms, a large (166 km2) enclosed basin in central Kansas, provides evidence for local and regional vegetation and climate change during the late Quaternary (ca. 30,000 yr.). Although radiocarbon dating of the carbonate-rich lacustrine sediments remains problematic, a basic chronological framework for the section is established. Two major litho- and biostratigraphic units, a Farmdalian zone (ca. 30,000 to 24,000 yr B.P.) and a Holocene zone (ca. 11,000 yr B.P. to present), are separated by a major unconformity spanning the Woodfordian (ca. 24,000 to 11,000 yr B.P.). Pollen and sedimentary data indicate a period of basin-wide drying preceding this unconformity. The sustained absence of sediment accumulation within this playa-like basin suggests that early Woodfordian conditions were increasingly arid with strengthened surface winds. Before this, persistent shallow water marshland dominated the local basin-bottom vegetation. Regional upland vegetation was an open grassland-sage steppe throughout the Farmdalian with limited populations of spruce, juniper, aspen, birch, and boxelder in riparian settings and escarpments.

The sites extend across an ecoclimatic transect through the boreal forest of central Canada, from aspen parkland to sub-arctic woodland. Sites were selected using satellite, air photograph, and forest cover map data. Each site represents a minimum 100 m by 100 m homogeneous stand, suitable for satellite imaging. Data collected at each site covers overstory (species composition, DBH, pathogens, age, etc.), understory (percent cover by species), debris, and soil characteristics. These data provide a background database for the diverse measurements of terrestrial ecology, land surface climatology, tropospheric chemistry, and remote sensing. Such data provide an important baseline for ongoing studies of the boreal forest in a region sensitive to global change. The results of this study aid integration of a variety of more detailed studies being carried out in the region and also allow comparison with other international studies of a similar nature. Sites are concentrated in two regions: north of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and west of Thompson, Manitoba. Additional sites are located in the area of the Boreal Forest Transect Case Study (BFTCS) between Batoche, Saskatchewan and Gillam, Manitoba. The surveyed sites were classified according to three criteria: dominant species (Picea mariana, Populus tremuloides, Pinus banksiana, or “mixed”), age (mature, immature, or young/recently disturbed), and productivity (low, medium, or high). Overstory and understory measurements were usually taken at three points within each site. Debris measurements were taken at two points, and soil measurements at one point per site. This paper focuses on overstory and debris data taken at 97 sites in 1993 and 1994. The sites are predominantly in medium and high productivity stands. Overstoiy. data, primarily from point-sampling, have been used to estimate stand basal areas, stem densities, volumes, and aboveground biomass (excluding foliage). Stand basal areas ranged from 5 m2 ha−1 to over 60 m2 ha−1. Stem densities ranged from a few hundred to over 40 000 stem ha−1. Estimates of total aboveground biomass range from a few Mg ha−1 to over 250 Mg ha−1. The Prince Albert sites tend to have greater values than Thompson for basal area, volume and biomass, but stem densities are highly variable. Detritus data show values from zero to 60 Mg ha−1. Generally, these values are small compared to aboveground biomass, but in recently disturbed sites the detrital mass can exceed aboveground biomass.",http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01182839?LI=true,Article,1995

In vitro raised poplar shoots rooted 100% when treated by NAA (0.3 mg/l) for 7 h, the previously determined duration of the inductive phase. Spermidine and aminoguanidine (AG, an inhibitor of diamine oxidase) alone were unable to promote rooting under these conditions, and counteracted the NAA rooting effect. Putrescine and cyclohexylamine (CHA, an inhibitor of spermidine synthase) on the contrary did not oppose the NAA effect and promoted up to 40% rooting when applied alone. The levels of free indoleacetic acid (IAA) and of its aspartate conjugate IAAsp elevated up to peaks situated at the 7th and 8th h, respectively in the basal parts of the NAA-treated shoots. Putrescine, when added toegether with NAA, did not affect the typical IAA and IAAsp increases (except a displacement of the peaks to the 8th and 10th h, respectively); when applied alone, it provoked elevation of their levels to limited extents. Quite similar results were recorded with CHA. Spermidine and AG counteracted the NAA induced elevations of IAA and IAAsp. The level of endogenous putrescine typically increased up to a peak at the 6th h in the basal part of the NAA-treated shoots only, was slightly affected by exogenous putrescine and CHA application but significantly reduced by spermidine and AG supply. The NAA inducing rooting treatment did not affect the variation of the levels of endogenous spermidine and spermine but putrescine treatment (also spermidine to a lesser extent) led to increases of their levels.

Our objectives were to determine if ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) can maintain sodium balance on quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) flower buds, an important winter food, and to determine if the buds' primary plant secondary metabolite (coniferyl benzoate) further compromises a bird's sodium balance. Captive ruffed grouse were fed either aspen buds (0.063 mg g - - ' sodium) or a formulated diet having different concentrations of coniferyl benzoate in no-choice feeding trials. Sodium excretion did not change in response to coniferyl benzoate intake or acid load from detoxication processes; however, birds were marginally in negative sodium balance (P = 0.035; -5.06 f 2.05 mg .kg- .d- I) when feeding on aspen buds. Sodium levels in the feces from free-ranging grouse (0.050 f 0.0 mg . g-I) and in their winter foods (0.065 mg . g-I) indicated that these birds likely maintained sodium balance.

Pregitzer",Variability in early height growth rate of forest trees: implications for retrospective studies of stand dynamics,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,25,5,767 - 776,Not found,"Retrospective studies of forest stand dynamics may rely on estimates of tree ages. In some of these studies, trees are aged near the stem base, while in other studies trees may be aged at breast height. An age correction may be added to breast-height ages in an attempt to account for average time to reach breast height and thus provide better estimates of total ages. Aging at breast height can provide estimates of stem and stand ages that are sufficient and appropriate for many studies of stand dynamics, for example, those focusing on the dynamics of canopy recruitment. However, the various aging methodologies will provide similar interpretations of actual stand age structures only if early height growth rates are not variable among stems, an assumption not likely to be true. Thus, aging at breast height, with or without a correction factor, may be inappropriate in studies that rely on accurate determination of tree establishment times. In the present study, variability of early height growth rates for several tree species common to Populus grandidentata Michx. forests is quantified by determining the number of years to reach breast height. Interpretations of stand age structures and dynamics are made based on total tree ages, breast-height ages, and corrected breast-height ages. The results are compared to explore the implications of ignoring variability in early height growth rates when interpreting development of the stands. For the study populations, early height growth rates were highly variable. Some variability was accounted for by differences in understory tolerance, establishment times, and regenerative modes. Intolerant species establishing early grew faster than more tolerant, later establishing species. Sprout-origin stems grew faster, and had much less variable growth rates, than did seed-origin stems. In the understory, hardwood regeneration grew faster than pine regeneration. Even after accounting for these factors, early height growth rates were still variable. Within replicate plots, cumulative establishment distributions based on breast-height ages always differed from those based on total ages, leading to different interpretations of stand age structures. Cumulative establishment distributions based on breast-height ages corrected for aging height differed 44% of the time from those based on total ages. The timing of understory reinitiation, an important dynamic in even-aged forests, was determined using the three aging methods and compared. The timing of understory reinitiation based on breast-height ages differed significantly from that derived using total ages, while that derived using corrected breast-height ages did not differ from the latter. These results suggest that interpretations of stand age structures and past dynamics based on breast-height ages should be viewed cautiously if the objectives of a study require accurate estimates of tree establishment times.",http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/12028,Article,1995

Meadow bromegrass (Bromus rtpartus Rehm.) has recently gained acceptance, but comparative information on smooth and meadow bromegrass in grass-alfalfa mixtures is unavailable. We examined DM yield of binary grass-legume mixtures containing either Carlton or Manchar smooth bromegrass or Regar meadow bromegrass with Peace or Beaver alfalfa under a two-cut hay-management system.at four sites in central Alberta for 3 yr. Annual DM yield was 4O% greater (P < 0.0001) at sites near Lacombe (]570 kg ha-') than at Bluffton and Vegreville 6420 kg ha-'). Dry matter yield of smooth bromegrass mixtures (8020 kg ha-') was 20Vo higher (P < 0.01) than that of meadow bromegrass mixtures (6690 kg ha-') near Lacombe. Alfalfa DM yield was 2.1 times higher at Bluffton and Vegreville (2770k9 ha-') than near Lacombe (1300 kg ha-'). Near Lacombe, alfalfa regrowth was suppressed (P < 0.0001) by smooth bromegrass, which had 2.3 times larger (P < 0.001) tillers than meadow bromegrass at first cut. At Bluffton and Vegreville, DM yield of meadow bromegrass mixtures equalled or exceeded (P < 0.05) that of smooth bromegrass mixtures. Alttrough first-cut tiller weight of smooth bromegrass was73% more (P < 0.0001) than that of meadow bromegrass at Bluffton and Vegreville, tiller density of meadow bromegrass was 1.7 times greater (P < 0.m01) than that of smooth bromegrass. Results indicate that smooth brome- grass mixtures were superior to meadow bromegrass mixtures for hay production at moist fertile locations, despite reduced alfalfa persistence. At drier or less fertile sites, however, DM yield of meadow bromegrass mixtures was higher than that of smooth bromegrass mixtures when weather conditions for regrowth were favourable.",http://pubs.aic.ca/doi/pdf/10.4141/cjps95-071,Article,1995

Height and size of live trees, density of large dead trees, and volume of downed woody material increased during succession, whereas density of live trees decreased. Canopy heterogeneity had a bimodal relationship with succession: old forests had the highest, mature forests the lowest, and young forests an intermediate canopy heterogeneity. Old forests had greater bird species richness than young forests, which in turn had greater richness than mature forests. Twenty-seven, 3, and 10 bird species had their highest abundances in old, mature, and young forests, respectively. Seven bird species that nest and forage in canopy gaps and three bird species that nest and forage in large trees and snags were more abundant in young and old forests than in mature forests. Contrary to our predictions, patterns of richness and abundance for bird species that nest and forage in the canopy or in tree cavities were similar to those for bird species that nest or forage in the lower strata. Bird species preferring coniferous forests tended to be more abundant in old than in young or mature aspen-dominated forests, possibly because old aspen forests had more conifers than younger aspen forests.",http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1139/z95-167,Article,1995

Surface soil had been removed from all sites during construction, and spread over three of the four landings prior to tillage. Soil bulk density at the 0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm depths, and clod size distribution at the 0–30 cm depth were measured immediately after tillage. Bulk density of undisturbed and compacted (untilled) soil was also measured. Mean bulk density of compacted soil in haul roads was significantly greater than the bulk density of undisturbed soil, but not for landings. Tillage significantly reduced mean bulk density on three haul roads and two landings; subsurface soil was relatively dry at these sites. Most soils were difficult to fracture into small clods because these weakly aggregated soils were severely remoulded and compacted by equipment, particularly logging trucks operating on the haul roads. The degraded soil was massive and the strenght of the surface soil layers was generally much higher than was the strength of lower soil layers; this resulted in the subsoil deforming around the wings of the subsoiler rather than fracturing the surface soil. Fracturing of compacted soil into small clods was apparently enhanced by at least 2 years of frost action. The winged subsoiler was only moderately effective at fracturing recently compacted soil because of an often high soil water content, but it was observed that sites where soil was broken into large clods was loosened by frost action the following winter. Alternative methods of tilling compacted soil that insure soil fracturing over a wider range of soil water contents are needed for loosening compacted soil in northern boreal forests.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378112794901562,Article,1994

Southern blot analyses indicate that pA2 and pA3 correspond to two or three genes in each class of isoenzymes.

Bacterial and fungal biomass were determined by selective inhibition of substrate-induced respiration (SIR) by streptomycin and cycloheximide. Bacterial and fungal biovolume were determined by epifluorescence microscopy using acridine orange and calcofluor white M2R for staining of bacteria and fungi, respectively. SIR inhibition was optimized by testing a wide range of inhibitor concentrations and different substrates.In general, air-drying (20°C, 14 days) caused only slight reductions (< 10%) in microbial biomass (SIR) in each of the layers. The effect of air-drying on bacteria and fungi depended on the soil materials. In general, most of the measurements indicated little changes in bacterial and fungal populations after air-dried layers had been rewetted. Basal respiration was increased strongly in each of the rewetted layers and C metabolized during the burst in respiration may have originated from killed microorganisms in aspen L, F and H, but other C resources presumably were also made available by air-drying of aspen ah and pine F/H.During incubation of rewetted layers bacterial biomass and biovolume increased for 10 days in most of the layers, resulting in a decrease in the fungal-to-bacterial ratio. Then, between days 10 and 40 fungi became more dominant in most of the layers and the fungal-to-bacterial ratio increased.Each of the indices measured to determine changes in bacterial and fungal populations were correlated significantly. The correlation between SIR inhibition by cycloheximide and ergosterol content was particularly high (r2 = 0.83) and an overall mean of 11 mg ergosterol g− fungal biomass C was obtained, indicating that changes in fungal populations in forest layers can be monitored accurately by measuring ergosterol contents. The usefulness of each of the methods used to characterize changes in bacterial and fungal populations in soil is discussed.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071794900930,Article,1994

Wetwood, which is difficult to dry, is commonly associated with these dark centers. SDR processing involves drying 7/4- to 8/4-thick live-sawn flitches. Drying the flitch and then sawing studs produces straighter studs than sawing first and drying in stud form. High-temperature kiln drying (230 o F to 240 o F) has given good results with several species (such as, basswood and yellow-poplar). For species likely to contain wetwood (aspen, cottonwood, willow), high-temperature drying is not recommended. A kiln schedule for aspen with maximum temperatures of 190 o F to 200 o F followed by equalizing at 12 percent EMC is suggested.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7948&context=aspen_bib,Contribution to Book,1990

Selected forage species were sampled on burned and adjacent unburned areas during the summers of the first and second years after autumn prescribed burning of three sites in southeastern Idaho. These samples were analyzed for in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), crude protein, calcium, and phosphorus. This aspen type has a highly nutritious understory irrespective of burning. We found additional improvement in forage quality as a result of prescribed burning. In the middle of the first summer, aspen on the burned areas had higher crude protein and phosphorus contents, higher elk IVDMD, lower calcium contents, and lower calcium/phosphorus ratios than aspen had on the unburned areas. A month later, only crude protein levels of aspen remained higher on the burns. All of the shrubs analyzed in the first summer had higher crude protein levels on the burned areas. A year later, none of the shrubs or forbs on the burns had better forage quality than those under nearby unburned aspen. Pinegrass (Ga/amagrostis rubescens) on the burned areas in the second summer had more robust growth but lower IVDMD and crude protein values, likely due to more extensive flowering and seed production, than did pinegrass on unburned areas. Prescribed burning on these sites changed species composition from dense shrub motts to more palatable and nutritious forbs than were found on the unburned areas.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7950&context=aspen_bib,Report,1989

Several 14C-(lignin)-lignocelluloses labelled in the 3 side chain position were prepared by infusing plant stems for seven days with the lignin precursor, 14C-cinnamic acid. Based on acid and alkali solubilites, the lignin precursor was more deeply incorporated into the lignin polymer than usually reported for 14C-(lignin)-lignocellulose preparations. N. exitiosus was able to degrade a 14C-(U-ring)-synthetic lignin (5% breakdown) and the lignin component of certain hardwood 14C-(lignin)-lignocelluloses (about 4–6.5% breakdown), but not the lignin component of softwood 14C-(lignin)-lignocellulose. Both C. acinaciformis and M. darwiniensis were less able to degrade any of the 14C-lignins than N. exitiosus. The difference may be due to their possessing different types of gut symbionts. Most of the degradation by N. exitiosus took place during the first week of the 14 day bioassays. Very low amounts (0.03–0.21%) were degraded in the faeces.",http://www.springerlink.com/content/rvw648p1435213j5/,Article,1987

Its ability to exploit soil nutrient patches was compared to that of the closely related but caespitose E. lanceolatus ssp. wawawaiensis. 2 Clones of 14 genets of each taxon were planted in boxes consisting of two 30 x 30 cm cells: the 'origin cell' where clones were planted, and the adjacent 'destination cell', with each cell containing soil with either low or high levels of nutrients. 3 The rhizomatous taxon, which can produce intravaginal, short-rhizome and long- rhizome tillers, preferentially produced short-rhizome and intravaginal tillers in high- nutrient destination cells. Effects of nutrient status of the origin cell as well as of the destination cell on total tiller numbers indicated clonal integration, yet tiller placement responded to local conditions. 4 Roots of both taxa accessed nutrients in destination cells (the caespitose subspecies by root growth only), and above-ground biomass of both taxa increased to a similar extent with high-nutrient destination cells. With the patch sizes used in this experiment, root growth was as important as ramet placement in exploiting nutrients in destination cells. 5 There was no relationship between degree of plasticity in ramet placement and biomass of the clone when high-nutrient destination cells were present.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8569&context=aspen_bib,Article,1987

However, beyond the early seedling stage, the two grasses had a remarkably similar whole-plant RGR in hydroponic culture and aboveground RGR in glasshouse soil, if root temperatures were above approximately 12° C. At soil temperatures between 5 and 12° C, A. desertorum exhibited a 66% greater aboveground RGR than A. spicatum (P < 0.05). Both species responded similarly to warming soil temperatures. In the field, however, tiller growth rates were generally similar. Neither species showed marked tiller elongation until a couple of weeks after snowmelt, by which time soil temperatures, at least to a depth of 10 cm, were above 12° C for a significant portion of the day. Above-ground biomass accumulation over a three-year period indicated that both grasses had similar potential growth rates whereas Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana, a common neighbor planted in the same plots, had a much greater potential growth rate. The greater competitive ability of adult A. desertorum, as compared to A. spicatum, cannot be attributed to appreciable differences in potential growth rates.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8568&context=aspen_bib,Article,1987

Aspen’s ability to grow in full sunlight and vegetatively regenerate via root suckering allows it to thrive following fire, or other disturbance. Although aspen is susceptible to many diseases and damaging agents, it persists through periodic natural regeneration episodes driven by disturbance. Deteriorating aspen stands result when this natural cycle of renewal is interrupted, as has happened with wildfire suppression and excessive utilization of young aspen by browsing animals. The aspen regeneration triangle, representing the critical factors of hormonal stimulation, proper growth environment, and protection of new regeneration can serve as a useful guide in planning management actions in aspen forests.",https://www.safnet.org/fp/documents/aspen_mgt_08.pdf,Contribution to Book,1985

Urness",Feeding behavior and habitat preference of deer and elk on northern Utah summer range,The Journal of Wildlife Management,47,3,646 - 663,Not found,"The feeding behaviors and habitat preferences of tame, free-ranging mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus) and elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) were determined in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) types. Mule deer and elk exhibited strong grazing preference for open habitat subunits. Elk most preferred highly productive meadow bottoms, whereas deer most preferred less productive clear-cut lodgepole pine and aspen forest. Clear-cutting greatly increased deer and elk grazing use of these areas in the lodgepole pine type, but aspen clear-cuts were used at about the same level as uncut aspen. The lack of mule deer use of meadow bottoms was attributed to their need for a more digestible diet. Mule deer were generally more selective than elk, especially in meadow subunits, where density of vegetation and abundance of nonpreferred grasses and sedges apparently interfered with forage selection and prevented maximum forage consumption rates. Elk were apparently better adapted than deer to using a more diverse array of plant species as food. Consumption rates were highest on subunits the animals most preferred to graze. That both species made considerable use of less preferred habitat, where consumption rates were relatively low, suggests that deer and elk are innately motivated to explore their environments for alternate food resources. Elk generally preferred to bed wherever they finished feeding, although always in close proximity to cover. Mule deer generally retreated to specific beds that they used repeatedly throughout the summer.",http://www.jstor.org/stable/3808601,Article,1983

On June 1, 1978 the stored (October 1977) and the fresh (May 1978) root cuttings were planted in a greenhouse propagation bench. All sprouts that developed were allowed to grow on half of the 10-cm long root cuttings randomly selected as controls.

Fisher,An evaluation of steam-treated aspen as a substitute for corn silage in the rations of lactating cows,Canadian Journal of Animal Science,60,2,379 - 384,Not found,"Fifteen lactating Holsteins were used to test processed aspen added to corn silage at the levels of 0, 10 and 20% (dry matter basis). The experiment was designed as a latin square with three experimental periods each 42 days in length. The forage mixtures were fed free choice to the cows, which were housed in a free-stall barn, and their individual feed intakes were recorded by using electronic doors. The processed aspen contained 45.4% dry matter, 73.7% acid detergent fiber and 0.54% protein. There was no evidence of heating or mold growth in the aspen during the 5 mo of the trial. Silage dry matter intake and milk yield were 11.8, 13.4 and 13.4 and 25.7, 27.0 and 26.8 kg per day, respectively, for the silage mixtures containing 0, 10 and 20% processed aspen. Fat test was decreased slightly and milk protein content significantly (P P > 0.05) by the inclusion of aspen chips in the silage. Neither the molar proportion of acetic acid nor the ratio of acetic acid to propionic acid in the rumen fluid was changed when the cows were fed silage containing processed aspen chips. The apparent digestibilities of total ration dry matter and protein were lowered significantly by the addition of 10% aspen chips to the forage mixture. It was concluded from the results of this trial that steam-processed aspen chips had little nutritive value when fed to lactating cows as a partial substitute for corn silage.",http://pubs.aic.ca/doi/abs/10.4141/cjas80-047,Article,1980

On the basis of separate analysis for lakes and streams, a land capability classification system was developed for beaver. The regression equations are also useful as models of beaver-habitat relationships and can be used for beaver inventory by prediction of beaver colony site density.

Frost dieback is a freeze-killed segment of the stem at the base, tip, or mid-portion of a branch or leader. It may or may not enhance natural pruning or poplar branches depending on whether the basal parts are damaged or alive and able to form abscission layers. In addition to abscission, low temperature affects increment, growth patterns, and vigor of poplar. Tree become stunted from persistent leader dieback. Suckers, crooks, and sweeps also characterize many stands of poplar. These characteristics of frost damage in mature forest stands are valuable in assessing the hazard of frost if the stands are to be clear-cut and reforested. The effects of frost damage are controlled somewhat in amenity, parks, and recreational areas because pruning is necessary to prevent wind breakage of staghead and frost-cankered trees.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8094&context=aspen_bib,Article,1976

Photosynthesis was higher for Engelmann spruce seedlings grown in the shade than in the open, but it was not significantly different for lodgepole pine seedlings. Spruces reached near-maximum photosynthesis at 4,000 to 5,000 ft-c, but pines did not appear light-saturated even at 12,000 ft-c. Photosynthesis and respiration of potted spruce seedlings were highest at moisture deficits less than 10 percent; with deficits above 20 percent, photosynthesis was zero and respiration minimal. At a deficit of 58 percent seedlings died. Moisture deficits of seedlings during the summer after field planting were below 31 percent and did not differ significantly between sunrise or mid-afternoon measurements, nor between shaded or open-grown treatments. These and other results suggest that solarization occurs in unshaded spruce, has a deleterious effect on photosynthesis, and may be associated with the high mortality in plantations at elevations above 10,000 ft.

Cost, demand, and harvesting and marketing practices change as conditions change.

The present use of approximately 440 thousand cords of aspen as pulpwood is relatively small in comparison to the allowable annual drain of over 2 million cords (1, 2) .2/ Though the use of softwood pulpwood in the Lake States will undoubtedly continue to be highly important, the potentialities of aspen as pulp and paper-making materials are such that its utilization for these purposes may readily be increased to a volume considerably greater than at present. Such an expanded use, however, would require not only an increase in production by present methods but the development of modified and new processes, modified paper formulas, some new products, and possibly the manufacture of some products not now manufactured extensively in the Lake States. Some of these will be discussed herein.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7685&context=aspen_bib,Report,1947

Smith,Seasoning of Aspen,Lake States Aspen Report No. 5,Not found,5,1 - 19,Not found,"Aspen is nor; the major forest type in the Lake States, and extensive stands are reaching maturity. Increasing quantities are being cut, and much is nor; being put to new and more exacting uses that require better air - seasoning and kiln-drying practices. The recent favorable market for green aspen lumber appears to be falling off, and the time may soon come when operators are no longer able to move green aspen. Such a change can be met by manufacturing better-quality aspen lumber and by carefully seasoning it to the desired moisture content to make it more acceptable. This report describes the principles of air seasoning and kiln drying as developed from research at the Forest Products Laboratory, with specific recommendations for the seasoning of aspen lumber, flitches, and shook stock. More detailed information may be obtained from the publications listed at the end of this report, most of which are available at the Forest Products Laboratory.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7684&context=aspen_bib,Article,1947

Only the axe and the ingenuity of the pioneer were needed to erect a shelter against the elements of nature. Early in the 19th century, the circular saw came into use resulting in a change in building construction. The pine stands in New England and in the Lake States, considered inexhaustible in the 19th century, were converted to lumber to construct buildings necessary for the rapid development of the country. Log cabin construction continued on a very small scale but was largely confined to the inaccessible parts of the country where a cheap and plentiful supply of good building logs still existed. Today, with lumber and pulpwood prices the highest in the history of the country, aspen is about the only cheap and plentiful building log material in the northern Lake States.",https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7682&context=aspen_bib,Article,1947

The annual cut of aspen lumber in the region increased from approximately 67 million board feet in 1941 to 152 million board feet in 1946. In spite of this increased use, aspen still remains the only major tree species in the Lake States in which annual growth exceeds annual drain.

Be- cause of a rapidly expanding market for all forest products during the past decade, particularly during the war, the attention and ingenuity of industry have turned toward the use of aspen. As a consequence, aspen has now become one of the important pulpwood species in the Lake States, and is used for many other products. That it will retain its place for some time to come seems quite certain in view of its large acreage, its aggressiveness, and new uses which are constantly being found.
