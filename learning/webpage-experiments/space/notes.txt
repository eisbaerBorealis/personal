This project will be a cartoony animated solar system.

Ultimately I'd like to pull celestial objects from a json file and have them rotate around the sun.
    Maybe even allow a mouseover on the objects identifying them?

MVP:
    Black background, randomly placed starfield
    Yellow ball in middle
    Multiple colored balls circling it at the same speed (distance, not angle)

Planet A moving at speed X:
    Full rotation = 2 * pi * (orbit radius)
    X is a set speed for all planets
    Each planet object will have a size, color, orbit radius, and angle
        Drawing will be done with sine and cosine
    Each tick will need to calculate the change in angle
    X / Circumference = Angle change / (2 * pi)
    Angle change (radians) = 2 * pi * X / Circumference
        Angle change (radians) = 2 * pi * X / (2 * pi * radius)
        Angle change (radians) = X / radius
            Yeah, that sounds like something from calculus...
    If angle > 2 * pi, subtract 2 * pi

Each Planet object (including the sun) needs to have:
    name:   the name of the object
    size:   a value between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the radius of the planet
    color:  color fill of the planet
    orbit:  a value between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the distance from the sun
    revolution: the angle in radians
